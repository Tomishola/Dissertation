When ranking players' value, they take a wide range of factors into account: age, contract length, form and so on. </p> <p> A total of nine different clubs are represented in the top 10, with <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc\\\">Arsenal</a> the only club having two players on the list. Here, <b>Mirror Football</b> gives you the rundown on the league's most valuable goalkeepers... </p>  <h3>10. Arijanet Muric - Burnley (\\u20ac20million/\\u00a317.3m)</h3> <p>After losing his spot as Burnley's first-choice goalkeeper to new signing James Trafford, Aijanet Muric is probably the most surprising name on the list. However, the 24-year-old was excellent in the Championship last year, while his age and the fact he is under contract until 2026 help boost his value.</p> <h3>9. Emiliano Martinez - Aston Villa (\\u20ac20m/\\u00a317.3m)</h3> <p>A World Cup winner with Argentina last year, Emiliano Martinez has developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world after enjoying a breakthrough at Arsenal in 2020 when Bernd Leno was sidelined with an injury. After joining Aston Villa later that same year, Martinez has continued to impress and the 31-year-old signed a three-year contract extension last January.</p> <h3>8. David Raya - Arsenal (\\u20ac20m/\\u00a317.3m)</h3> <div data-redesign-embed=\\\"true\\\">\\n<figure data-orientation=\\\"landscape\\\" data-tmdatatrack-articleid=\\\"30709251\\\" data-tmdatatrack=\\\"inline-widget\\\" itemprop=\\\"image\\\" itemscope=\\\"itemscope\\\" itemtype=\\\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\\\">\\n<meta itemprop=\\\"url\\\" content=\\\"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30709251.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Arsenal-Unveil-New-Signing-David-Raya.jpg\\\">\\n<meta itemprop=\\\"width\\\" content=\\\"615\\\">\\n<meta itemprop=\\\"height\\\" content=\\\"472\\\">\\n<meta itemprop=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"David Raya joined Arsenal over the summer\\\">\\n<meta itemprop=\\\"author\\\" content=\\\"(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30709251.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Arsenal-Unveil-New-Signing-David-Raya.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30709251.ece/ALTERNATES/s458b/0_Arsenal-Unveil-New-Signing-David-Raya.jpg 458w, https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30709251.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Arsenal-Unveil-New-Signing-David-Raya.jpg 615w\\\" alt=\\\"David Raya joined Arsenal over the summer\\\" content=\\\"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30709251.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Arsenal-Unveil-New-Signing-David-Raya.jpg\\\" layout=\\\"responsive\\\" width=\\\"615\\\" data-tmdatatrack=\\\"inline-widget\\\" data-tmdatatrack-articleid=\\\"30709251\\\" height=\\\"472\\\">\\n\\n\\n</img>\\n</figure>\\n<figcaption>\\n<span>David Raya joined Arsenal over the summer</span>\\n<span> (\\n<p><span></span>Image:\\n</p>Arsenal FC via Getty Images)</span>\\n</figcaption>\\n</div> <p> Currently on loan at Arsenal from Brentford with an option for the deal to be made permanent next summer, David Raya is now competing with <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aaron-ramsdale\\\">Aaron Ramsdale</a> for the No 1 spot at the Emirates. Spanish international Raya did sign a two-year contract extension with Brentford before joining the Gunners in case they do not take up the option to buy. </p> <h3>7. Jordan Pickford - Everton (\\u20ac20m/\\u00a317.3m)</h3> <p> England's first-choice goalkeeper under Gareth Southgate, <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jordan-pickford\\\">Jordan Pickford</a> made the move to <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc\\\">Everton</a> in 2017 after impressing as Sunderland were relegated to the Championship. The 29-year-old has come in for criticism over the years, but he remains one of Everton's key players after committing his future to the club until the end of 2027 earlier this year. </p> <h3>6. Odysseas Vlachodimos - Nottingham Forest (\\u20ac30m/\\u00a326m)</h3> <p> Another surprising name on the list, Odysseas Vlachodimos joined <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc\\\">Nottingham Forest</a> from Benfica over the summer on a four-year deal. However, the 29-year-old is yet to play a game for Forest with Matt Turner their new first-choice following his move from Arsenal. </p> <h3>5.

The 25-year-old signed a seven-year contract with the Blues and has started every game since joining the club. </p> <h3>4. Andre Onana - Man Utd (\\u20ac50m/\\u00a343.4m)</h3> <p> Another new signing, <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\\\">Manchester United</a> forked out an initial \\u00a343.8m to sign Andre Onana from Inter Milan as David de Gea's replacement. The Cameroon international played a key role in Inter's run to the <a data-content-type=\\\"section-topic\\\" data-link-tracking=\\\"InArticle|Link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/champions-league\\\">Champions League</a> final last season, but has not enjoyed the greatest start to life at Old Trafford. </p> <h3>3.

Ederson - Man City (\\u20ac60m/\\u00a352.1m)</h3> <p>Having been signed in 2017 from Benfica as a replacement for Claudio Bravo, Ederson has also been integral to Manchester City's success under Pep Guardiola. During his time at the Etihad, Ederson has won five Premier League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups and a Champions League.</p> <h3>1. Aaron Ramsdale - Arsenal (\\u20ac80m/\\u00a369.5m)</h3> <p>A surprising name at number one given he appears to have been usurped as Mikel Arteta's first-choice goalkeeper by Raya, Aaron Ramsdale is valued at almost \\u00a370m by The Football Observatory. He has impressed in his two seasons with the Gunners, but it remains to be seen what the future holds for him after the signing of Raya.</p> <p><b> <i>All rankings and valuations are courtesy of The Football Observatory.</i> </b></p> <p><i> Join our new WhatsApp community!

Paying an initial \\u00a343.8m for his services, the final fee for Onana will reach \\u00a347.8m once add-ons are factored in, <a href=\\\"https://www.teamtalk.com/news/the-10-most-expensive-goalkeeper-transfers-of-all-time-alisson-to-liverpool-kepa-to-chelsea\\\"><strong>putting him third on that all-time list</strong></a>.</p>\\n<p>Astonishingly, the 27-year-old had joined the Nerazzurri as a free agent just a year earlier, meaning Inter\\u2019s sale earned them a very handsome profit on their original investment.</p>\\n<p>However, Onana has made a woeful start to life at Old Trafford, conceding an alarming 10 goals from their six games to date. And while a clean sheet at Burnley on Saturday will have gone down well, the Cameroonian is clearly still adapting to his surroundings having conceded plenty of all-too-soft goals, including a tame effort from Leroy Sane in their loss to Bayern Munich on Wednesday night.</p>\\n<p>With Onana far from his best, reports over the weekend claim Inter felt at the time that <a href=\\\"https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/man-utd-mocked-overpaying-struggling-star-sale-seen-as-masterpiece-player-not-world-class\\\"><strong>Inter\\u2019s sale of Onana for such a high fee was \\u2018a masterpiece\\u2019 with United mocked for paying such a hefty amount</strong></a> for a player who it is felt will \\u2018never be considered world class\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>With several pundits also claiming the decision to replace long-serving David De Gea with Onana was the wrong one, speculation is now starting to mount that United are already in the market for an upgrade when the January window opens for business.</p>\\n<p><em><strong>READ MORE</strong></em>:&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/red-devils-news-ten-hag-tipped-to-take-ruthless-action-on-key-man-utd-position-pundit-questions-wisdom-of-huge-summer-decision\\\"><strong>Ten Hag tipped to take ruthless action on key position as pundit questions wisdom of huge summer decision</strong></a></p>\\n<h2><strong>Man Utd tipped to make \\u20ac50m move for Jan Oblak</strong></h2>\\n<p>And according to reports in Spain, United are casting their eyes towards long-standing Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak.</p>\\n<p>Oblak, still only 30, is now into his 10th season as an Atletico player, having established himself as not just one of the best in Spain, but also one of the world\\u2019s elite goalkeepers.</p>\\n<p>Indeed, United have themselves found themselves linked with a move for Oblak on multiple occasions over the years, despite having never made a concrete approach for the 58-times capped Slovenia international.</p>\\n<p>Now, however, that could be about to change with reports in Spain claiming Atletico are ready to put Oblak on the market ahead of the winter window opening in just 98 days\\u2019 time.</p>\\n<p>And per the reports, Los Rojoblancos are seeking a fee of \\u20ac50m (\\u00a343.6m) to sell Oblak \\u2013 ironically, near enough the same fee United shelled out to sign Onana over the summer.</p>\\n<p>That\\u2019s because Atletico officials fear Onana may well be past his best with his form having dipped in recent times. And fearing his valuation could plummet if that continues, Diego Simeone\\u2019s men are now reportedly ready to cash in on the long-serving star.</p>\\n\\n<p>Whether United can finance such a move, however, remains to be seen. And it would also be a major admission that the signing of Onana&nbsp; \\u2013 who was signed for his ability with the ball at his feet, as well as his shot-saving ability \\u2013 was a costly mistake.</p>\\n<p>Would United do that so soon? That appears extremely unlikely, especially with the Red Devils themselves finding in the past just how hard it is keeping two No 1s (at the time Dean Henderson was competing with De Gea) happy.</p>\\n<p>As such, it seems unlikely United will be making a move for Oblak despite such claims. Ten Hag is far more likely to spend such sums on more defensive additions, while another striker to take the burden off Rasmus Hojlund would also not go amiss.</p>\\n<p><em><strong>READ MORE</strong></em>:&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/man-utd-tried-trade-two-stars-hojlund-dane-worryingly-compared-flop-striker\\\"><strong>Man Utd tried to trade two stars for Hojlund, as Dane worryingly compared to flop striker</strong></a></p>\\n</div></div>\",\n",

They seem to hope so, but they will have to fend off competition from another Premier League club\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p><strong>UNITED, NEWCASTLE EYE JUVE MIDFIELDER</strong><br>\\nIt has been a few weeks since Adrien Rabiot was linked with Manchester United. So let\\u2019s put that right\\u2026</p>\\n<p>For the 427th time, the Juventus midfielder is said to be a target for the Red Devils in January when, yet again, <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.football365.com/news/feature-20-best-players-footballers-out-of-contract-free-agents-2024\\\">he will enter the final months of his contract</a></strong>. Rabiot was in a similar position last season but the France star eventually reached an agreement with Juve to extend his terms for the current campaign.</p>\\n<p>The Old Lady is keen to renew Rabiot once more, especially given <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.football365.com/news/souness-pogba-lazy-twt-criticism-ex-man-utd-midfielder\\\">the uncertainty around Paul Pogba\\u2019s future</a></strong>. But according to <em>Calciomercato</em>, United, who have retained a long-standing interest in the 28-year-old dating back to his PSG days, feel this could finally be their big chance to land the World Cup winner.</p>\\n<p>Of course, given Rabiot\\u2019s form last season when he scored 11 goals and offered six assists amid a renaissance under Max Allegri, United will face competition \\u2013 not just from Juve. Apparently Newcastle are also sniffing, as they were before his most recent contract renewal.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>MODRIC LINED UP FOR MIAMI MOVE</strong><br>\\nLuka Modric is in a similar position to Rabiot, with just under a year left on a contract he signed during the summer. Which makes him an ideal signing for David Beckham amid his on-going attempt to form the world\\u2019s best veteran\\u2019s team.</p>\\n<p><em>The Dubrovnik Times</em> says Beckham has earmarked Modric as one of his next big signings for Inter Miami, following the likes of Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. Luis Suarez is on his list of targets too.</p>\\n<p>Modric has had plenty of time to mull over his future while sat on Real Madrid\\u2019s bench. The 38-year-old has started only two of Real\\u2019s six La Liga games this season, including Sunday night\\u2019s 3-1 defeat to Atletico Madrid when he was substituted at half-time.</p>\\n<p>The 2018 Ballon d\\u2019Or winner will be a free-agent at the end of the season, giving Beckham and Miami plenty of time to work out their sums over how they can squeeze Modric on to the wage bill with everyone else.</p>\\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\\\"https://www.football365.com/news/feature-20-best-players-footballers-out-of-contract-free-agents-2024\\\">Mbappe and Barca starlets among 20 best players out of contract in 2024\\u2026</a></strong></p>\\n<!-- Article End --></div></div>\",\n",

Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali, and their friend the Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, went there on Saturday to give the players a piece of their mind, and yet by Tuesday it was just another strategy best quietly abandoned.\\n\\nThe issue with that kind of bold move is it leaves you nowhere to go when the problems remain the same. It has taken English football less than a year to chip away at the carefully-cultivated reputation of the new owners at Chelsea as the smartest men in the room. Having lectured the players following Saturday\\u2019s defeat by Brighton, they have discovered that all it guarantees is that the stakes get higher. With \\u00a3600 million spent on the revolution that has seen two managers thrown overboard, and Chelsea diminished in Europe and at home, those stakes are already high.\\n\\nNext season will likely be just the second in 20 years at Stamford Bridge when there has been no European football of one flavour or another at the stadium. The last time was in the aftermath of Jose Mourinho\\u2019s second spell meltdown, after 13 years of dizzying improvement. Chelsea came back to win the Premier League the following season under Antonio Conte and anything is, of course, possible next season. Even so, this rookie ownership is learning some hard lessons.\\nChelsea has ended its European football campaign after a lacklustre season that saw \\u00a3600m spent on the team as well as two managerial changes. The side\\u2019s owners, Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali and Hansjorg Wyss, visited the changing rooms after last week\\u2019s loss to Brighton but have been left with nowhere to turn as the team\\u2019s troubles continue. Chelsea's absence from European football will last for at least another 18 months, marking only the second such lull in 20 years for the club.\\nA consolation is that their new temporary manager and his assistant Ashley Cole are bonafide club legends because with a record of four defeats from four games and only a single goal scored, Frank Lampard needs every bit of faith the supporters can spare.\\n\\nEven Ralf Rangnick\\u2019s lamentable interim reign at Manchester United prompted a gentle initial bounce of two wins and two draws from the first four games. As things stand, the Bruno Saltor era \\u2013 one game, one draw, two weeks hence, overseen by a man who seemed to be managing simply because a clause in his contract insisted upon it \\u2013 looks like a golden time.  \\n  \\nFor Lampard this was a sinecure back at the club that once venerated him, a manager\\u2019s job that he always felt was given to him and then taken away before he has a chance to get going. It must have looked like a gloriously unlikely second chance. Four games in and he is putting a brave face on it. The consortium guys are at his elbow in the changing room and his old manager Carlo Ancelotti, is looking over with an arched eyebrow and a degree of sympathy.\\n\\n[image]Carlo Ancelotti and Frank Lampard - Todd Boehly and Co have nowhere left to go after yet another Chelsea failure\\n\\nEver more Lampard feels like he might be in an impossible position, and the longer it goes on, the interim coach seems less like a shrewd short-term option and more like a human shield.  \\n  \\nThis is where it gets hard for Boehly and Eghbali. They have swept up a collection of two technical directors and another of the sporting director variety with little sense that the power lies anywhere but with the two Americans. Are they really listening to anyone else? Any sporting director with a genuine authority and an opinion that was sought in moments of crisis would have counselled against that changing room visit on Saturday afternoon.\\nChelsea's temporary manager and assistant, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, are relying on the support of their \\\"bonafide club legends\\\" status after four defeats in four games and only one goal scored. Even Ralf Rangnick's interim reign at Manchester United produced two wins and two draws in the first four games. The current interim coach at Chelsea is beginning to look more like a human shield. The owners will need to start listening to other opinions before making important decisions.\\nLampard\\u2019s side were better against Real than they had been at home to Brighton three days earlier, and yet it was a tie that never felt truly in the balance. They created some chances and then, as befits a team that had failed to score in 17 previous games this season, they proceeded not to take any of them. Not since the 1980-81 season \\u2013 when Chelsea finished 12th in Division Two \\u2013 have they finished so many games without a goal. They look well on course to surpass that vintage year when they were outscored by Leyton Orient.  \\n  \\nA team that does not score goals starts to lack menace, and so Real never looked in discomfort. As a promising first hour faded in a way that felt familiar, Chelsea were picked off. With one game to save the season, Lampard selected a team that had just a single conventional forward in Kai Havertz, chiselled out of this strange collection of footballers.  \\n  \\nAfter the German, Conor Gallagher occupied the highest position up the pitch. Raheem Sterling was not trusted by his manager to start. Mason Mount was inexplicably left out of the side again, and only emerged as a late substitute. It does make you wonder just what might be the temperature of Mount\\u2019s contract stand-off. Mykhaylo Mudryk came on for another of those cameos that drift between moments of reckless intensity \\u2013 a foul on Luka Modric \\u2013 and shy uncertain finishes that mean he is now 13 games without his first Chelsea goal.  \\n  \\nSeventh place might be enough for a Uefa Europa Conference League place and yet Chelsea would have to make up 10 points in seven games, just for a Thursday night tour of all the places in Europe they have long thought they had left behind. It is a long way back.\\nChelsea failed to score in their match against Real Madrid, leading to their 18th game this season without a goal, dating back to the 1980s. This has resulted in a lack of menace and discomfort for opposing teams, as demonstrated by Real Madrid's confidence during the match. Despite the team\\u2019s promising first hour, they were eventually picked off, leading to their defeat. This was due to Lampard\\u2019s selection of an unconventional team, which did not include trusted players such as Mason Mount or the trust of the manager towards Raheem Sterling. The future of the team looks uncertain in terms of European competition, as they would need to make up 10 points in seven games to earn a Uefa Europa Conference League place.\"\n",

Results will be handed out to agents within seven business days and there will be no grounds to appeal a fail.\\n\\n\\u201cSome of the ways they have worded the questions kills you as they aren\\u2019t clear about what they want or how many multiple-choice answers you need to select,\\u201d one agent complained.\\n\\nShould only a small percentage of agents pass the test, FIFA are likely to reflect on the difficulty.\\n\\n\\u201cYou are basically reading contract law, so there is a small and subtle difference between each multiple-choice answer,\\u201d another agent said. \\u201cYou are reading some of them thinking, \\u2018F***ing hell\\u2019, but it will be good to get the exam done.\\u201d\\n\\nThe general feeling from agents is that it will raise standards across the board as they will require an understanding of the regulations.\\n\\nTheir gripe stems from the caps FIFA are putting on the money they can earn and the changes being made to dual and triple representation. There is concern that some of the bigger agencies may have to make staff redundant because their revenues are likely to shrink.\\n\\nFrom October, agents can only represent one client in a transaction, although they can act for two parties (the player and buying club) if written consent is provided. \\n\\nDeals like this are commonplace, and one glance at the most recent FA intermediary transactions list (2022-23) highlights many instances where an agent represents the player and buying club.\\n\\nUnder the new regulations, agents will no longer be allowed to represent the player and selling club, or the selling club and buying club. \\n\\nTriple representation, which is where one intermediary acts on behalf of the player and both the buying and selling club, is being outlawed. Last summer, for example, Kia Joorabchian represented Andreas Pereira (player), Manchester United (selling club) and Fulham (buying club) in the midfielder\\u2019s \\u00a38million ($9.9m) transfer.\\n\\nThe commission an agent can earn from a transfer will depend upon which party or parties they represent and how much the player will go on to earn.\\n\\nIf they act for the selling club, they can be paid up to 10 per cent of the transfer fee.\\n\\nOne agent pointed out that this element of the cap may create a conflict of interest as they could be paid more if they work for the club instead of their player. \\n\\nShould they represent the player or buying club, then their earnings will be capped at three per cent of a player\\u2019s annual remuneration if it is above $200,000.\\n\\nAgents\\u2019 fees will be capped at six per cent of the player\\u2019s annual salary if they represent the player and buying club in the same deal. It will be 10 per cent if the player\\u2019s gross salary is below $200,000 per annum.\\n\\nIntermediaries working on behalf of the player or buying club will have their commissions limited to 10 per cent of a player\\u2019s future annual earnings under $200,000 and at six per cent for anything above that salary for the length of the agreed contract.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMany agents have questioned the legality of the commission cap. \\n\\nThey view football as a free market where they can command whatever fee they want and if a club wants to pay it, then that is up to them.\\n\\nBarnett has publicly said he believes the market could quickly collapse under the new regulations.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is completely ill-thought-out and they have not spoken about what will and will not work,\\u201d a \\u2018legacy agent\\u2019 said. \\u201cThey have gone out there and are creating as much destruction as possible. I would not be surprised if they reverse the majority of it. I would be shocked if the commission cap stays in place.\\u201d\\n\\nOne agent raised concerns about whether clubs themselves will adhere to the caps, especially if a superstar player is on the market.\\n\\nA leading figure at a Premier League side, however, welcomes the changes.\\n\\n\\u201cThe clubs really want this in place,\\u201d they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. \\u201cIf they are going to go with caps and dual representation, which has become a massive issue, and will put a six per cent cap on fees, then great. \\n\\n\\u201cThe agents are angry about it, but the clubs want it and it is important to keep inflation in football under control.\\u201d\\n\\nPereira was represented by Joorabchian when he moved to Fulham from Manchester United \\u2013 with the agent also working for both clubs in the deal, too (Photo: Federico Maranesi/Getty Images)\\n\\nIn another change, clubs will no longer pay agents\\u2019 fees on the players\\u2019 behalf \\u2014 unless their annual remuneration is below $200,000. It has been normal for clubs to pay the agents on behalf of their players. The idea being that getting players to pay their agents will make them pay attention to how much commission is being paid for their services.\\n\\nAll the transactions will now be made public and players will be aware of how much their agent is earning from representing them.\\n\\nFIFA are railing against the narrative that they woke up one day and decided to overhaul the agency sector. Football\\u2019s governing body has been working on the regulations for five years and insists they have consulted with agents, agencies, players, clubs and leagues from across the world.\\n\\nWhile their commission from transfers will be capped, it has been pointed out to _The Athletic_ that agents can start charging for other services. Intermediaries often provide concierge, financial and accounting services for their players without charging them.\\n\\nThe leading figure at a Premier League club thinks agents will not lose out financially. \\u201cThe issue is that agents will just find another way, whether that\\u2019s through a loyalty fee or something else,\\u201d they said.\\n\\n\\u201cThey will all find ways around it because they will sit there and say, \\u2018Club X will pay a \\u00a31million signing-on fee; you won\\u2019t. So, therefore, we are going to club X\\u2019. \\n\\n\\u201cThe new regulations will only work if everyone gets behind it. Caps, sanctions and more control can only help, but it won\\u2019t stop them from finding new ways to circumvent the regulations.\\u201d\\n\\n _(Top image: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)_\\n\",\n",

After deregulating the industry in 2015, they now want tighter controls and to put a cap on how much agents can earn.\\n\\nThe changes have led to criticism from several \\u2018super agents\\u2019, including Jonathan Barnett, the chairman of CAA Stellar. Rafaela Pimenta, Mino Raiola\\u2019s business partner for more than two decades, spoke out against FIFA in a wide-ranging interview with _The Athletic_. \\n\\nPimenta is not in favour of changes to agent regulations (Photo: The Athletic)\\n\\nBarnett and Pimenta, along with other intermediaries, are involved in a legal dispute with FIFA in an attempt to stop the regulations \\u2014 most notably the cap on their fees \\u2014 from being implemented.\\n\\nThe agents who spoke to _The Athletic_ asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships with clubs and their clients, while being wary of the politics associated with FIFA.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe exam includes 20 multiple-choice questions, which need to be answered within an hour. If they fail, there is another test in September. The next sitting after that is in May 2024.\\n\\nTo prepare for the test, agents have been going through a 512-page exam-study document, which they can bring with them on the day as it is open-book, and were provided with one mock exam. \\n\\nAn intermediary will not have to sit the exam if they count as a \\u2018legacy agent\\u2019 and can provide proof they have been FIFA-registered as per the 1991, 1995, 2001 and 2008 regulations. \\n\\nIt means family members who represent players, unless they are a legacy agent, such as Barnett, 73, will need to sit the exam. \\n\\nFor example, Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane\\u2019s agent is his brother, Charlie, while West Ham United midfielder Declan Rice is represented by his father, Sean.\\n\\n\\u201cSome of the questions in the mock exam were stupidly hard,\\u201d one intermediary told _The Athletic_. \\u201cYou can cross-reference the regulations, but there are 512 pages and you are desperately flicking through trying to find the correct article.\\u201d\\n\\nThe digital exam is only available in three languages \\u2014 English, French and Spanish \\u2014 and candidates must bring their own laptop to the venue. In England, the exam will take place at ExCel London. They were initially instructed to bring an internet hotspot as mobile phones are banned, but wifi is now being provided after a late intervention. \\n\\nBefore the exam was scrapped in 2015, the test was notoriously difficult and the pass rate was thought to be below 20 per cent. The pass mark will be 15 correct answers out of 20.\\n\\nKane, Tottenham\\u2019s record goalscorer and the England captain, is represented by his brother, Charlie (Photo: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)\\n\\nFor this year\\u2019s exam, FIFA wanted to find the balance between making it difficult enough so that it is a challenge and not wanting everyone to fail. Results will be handed out to agents within seven business days and there will be no grounds to appeal a fail.\\n\\n\\u201cSome of the ways they have worded the questions kills you as they aren\\u2019t clear about what they want or how many multiple-choice answers you need to select,\\u201d one agent complained.\\n\\nShould only a small percentage of agents pass the test, FIFA are likely to reflect on the difficulty.\\n\\n\\u201cYou are basically reading contract law, so there is a small and subtle difference between each multiple-choice answer,\\u201d another agent said. \\u201cYou are reading some of them thinking, \\u2018F***ing hell\\u2019, but it will be good to get the exam done.\\u201d\\n\\nThe general feeling from agents is that it will raise standards across the board as they will require an understanding of the regulations.\\n\\nTheir gripe stems from the caps FIFA are putting on the money they can earn and the changes being made to dual and triple representation. There is concern that some of the bigger agencies may have to make staff redundant because their revenues are likely to shrink.\\n\\nFrom October, agents can only represent one client in a transaction, although they can act for two parties (the player and buying club) if written consent is provided. \\n\\nDeals like this are commonplace, and one glance at the most recent FA intermediary transactions list (2022-23) highlights many instances where an agent represents the player and buying club.\\n\\nUnder the new regulations, agents will no longer be allowed to represent the player and selling club, or the selling club and buying club.\\nMore than 6,500 football agents worldwide will sit an hour-long FIFA exam on 1 August, that includes 20 multiple-choice questions, which they have to pass in order to continue working. The exam is part of a regulatory overhaul of the sector by FIFA, which now wants to put a cap on agents\\u2019 earnings after deregulating the industry in 2015. Some agents are critical of the changes, including Jonathan Barnett, the chairman of CAA Stellar, and Rafaela Pimenta, who has been in a legal dispute with FIFA. From October, agents will only be able to represent one client but can act for two parties.\\nTriple representation, which is where one intermediary acts on behalf of the player and both the buying and selling club, is being outlawed. Last summer, for example, Kia Joorabchian represented Andreas Pereira (player), Manchester United (selling club) and Fulham (buying club) in the midfielder\\u2019s \\u00a38million ($9.9m) transfer.\\n\\nThe commission an agent can earn from a transfer will depend upon which party or parties they represent and how much the player will go on to earn.\\n\\nIf they act for the selling club, they can be paid up to 10 per cent of the transfer fee.\\n\\nOne agent pointed out that this element of the cap may create a conflict of interest as they could be paid more if they work for the club instead of their player. \\n\\nShould they represent the player or buying club, then their earnings will be capped at three per cent of a player\\u2019s annual remuneration if it is above $200,000.\\n\\nAgents\\u2019 fees will be capped at six per cent of the player\\u2019s annual salary if they represent the player and buying club in the same deal. It will be 10 per cent if the player\\u2019s gross salary is below $200,000 per annum.\\n\\nIntermediaries working on behalf of the player or buying club will have their commissions limited to 10 per cent of a player\\u2019s future annual earnings under $200,000 and at six per cent for anything above that salary for the length of the agreed contract.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMany agents have questioned the legality of the commission cap. \\n\\nThey view football as a free market where they can command whatever fee they want and if a club wants to pay it, then that is up to them.\\n\\nBarnett has publicly said he believes the market could quickly collapse under the new regulations.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is completely ill-thought-out and they have not spoken about what will and will not work,\\u201d a \\u2018legacy agent\\u2019 said. \\u201cThey have gone out there and are creating as much destruction as possible. I would not be surprised if they reverse the majority of it. I would be shocked if the commission cap stays in place.\\u201d\\n\\nOne agent raised concerns about whether clubs themselves will adhere to the caps, especially if a superstar player is on the market.\\n\\nA leading figure at a Premier League side, however, welcomes the changes.\\n\\n\\u201cThe clubs really want this in place,\\u201d they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. \\u201cIf they are going to go with caps and dual representation, which has become a massive issue, and will put a six per cent cap on fees, then great. \\n\\n\\u201cThe agents are angry about it, but the clubs want it and it is important to keep inflation in football under control.\\u201d\\n\\nPereira was represented by Joorabchian when he moved to Fulham from Manchester United \\u2013 with the agent also working for both clubs in the deal, too (Photo: Federico Maranesi/Getty Images)\\n\\nIn another change, clubs will no longer pay agents\\u2019 fees on the players\\u2019 behalf \\u2014 unless their annual remuneration is below $200,000. It has been normal for clubs to pay the agents on behalf of their players. The idea being that getting players to pay their agents will make them pay attention to how much commission is being paid for their services.\\n\\nAll the transactions will now be made public and players will be aware of how much their agent is earning from representing them.\\n\\nFIFA are railing against the narrative that they woke up one day and decided to overhaul the agency sector. Football\\u2019s governing body has been working on the regulations for five years and insists they have consulted with agents, agencies, players, clubs and leagues from across the world.\\n\\nWhile their commission from transfers will be capped, it has been pointed out to _The Athletic_ that agents can start charging for other services. Intermediaries often provide concierge, financial and accounting services for their players without charging them.\\n\\nThe leading figure at a Premier League club thinks agents will not lose out financially. \\u201cThe issue is that agents will just find another way, whether that\\u2019s through a loyalty fee or something else,\\u201d they said.\\n\\n\\u201cThey will all find ways around it because they will sit there and say, \\u2018Club X will pay a \\u00a31million signing-on fee; you won\\u2019t. So, therefore, we are going to club X\\u2019. \\n\\n\\u201cThe new regulations will only work if everyone gets behind it. Caps, sanctions and more control can only help, but it won\\u2019t stop them from finding new ways to circumvent the regulations.\\u201d\\n\\n _(Top image: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)_\\nFIFA has introduced new regulations regarding agents' fees, with caps introduced for commissions earned in player transfers. Agents who represent selling clubs are eligible to earn up to 10% of transfer fees, with three per cent of a player\\u2019s annual remuneration the maximum limit from representation of either the buying club or the player. Investors are prohibited from owning any economic interest in players, as will be agents' ability to represent both the buying and selling clubs involved in a transfer.

            "                    \"mini_summary\": \"If nothing else, Leeds United\\u2019s regression towards the end of Simon Grayson\\u2019s stint as manager allowed someone to do a decent trade in T-shirts. \\u201cKeep calm and pass to Snodgrass\\u201d was the slogan on the front of them and for as long as Robert Snodgrass was willing to stick it out, the slogan was not far wrong.\\n\\nGood teams tend not to be excessively reliant on one player but poor or mediocre teams, of which Leeds were one throughout the 2011-12 season, depend more on isolated inspiration. Promotion in 2020, for example, was a sum of many parts, individual quality wrapped up in collective class, stretching across the pitch and into the dugout. But the club are back to needing a Snodgrass, someone untouched by the general malaise.\\n\\nMoney alone says Georginio Rutter should possess an ounce of that talismanic dust. Rutter is young, admittedly, and visibly raw but he is Leeds\\u2019 most costly signing and 25 benign minutes on the pitch against Liverpool on Monday were, in microcosm, a partial example of why their season has reached crisis mode for a second time. Here is where vision crosses the line into luxury.\\n\\nAs a club and a business, Leeds like to build or to tell themselves they are building: hefty academy recruitment, a squad intended to peak at a later date and stadium redevelopment ideas that might get off the ground some day.\\n\\nIn future years, the theory is supposed to speak for itself because the decisions taken now, the gambles on longer-term growth, will be justified in time. Except to the naked eye, the short term is on fire and what comes next is wholly linked to it. Put another way, the blueprint of growth cannot have included the process of Leeds going down.\\n\\nRutter trudges off after Leeds\\u2019 abject display against Liverpool (Photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe club have factored in the possibility that they might because, according to their latest accounts, they think they have adequate resources to recover quickly if they do. Maybe and if recent promotions are a good gauge, relegated clubs have rarely found the Championship easier to navigate.\\n\\nBut it is not the point and the purpose of recruitment in the Premier League, the expenditure of renewing a squad, to make a team competitive in the EFL. Leeds might be well placed to bounce back if the worst happens but not without reputational damage or consequences in the meantime.\\n\\nRutter, to return to him, is a well-regarded prospect. There were plenty of recruitment departments in Europe watching him while Leeds were scouting him and plenty who saw him as a potentially worthwhile investment.\\n\\nThere are clubs out there who could have signed him without the need for immediate impact on the basis that impact was already coming from existing players in their camp.\\n\\nBut Leeds? Leeds needed Rutter to make his presence felt in some form, to influence this season and nudge them forward. Peak Rutter wasn\\u2019t going to materialise at the age of 20 but at \\u00a330million ($37.3m) or thereabouts had to make an impact on results that were nowhere near under control when he signed in January.\\n\\nIn three months, Rutter has completed 234 minutes in the Premier League and started once. He has registered no goals, no assists, no shots on target and three shots in total.\\n\\nThe scenario is one where Leeds\\u2019 record signing, the priciest player in their squad and their history, is not far off a bystander: sent on from the bench at 3-1 down to Arsenal, 5-1 down to Crystal Palace and 4-1 down to Liverpool.\\n\\nHe played up front against Chelsea because neither Rodrigo nor Patrick Bamford were fit enough to fill that position but Javi Gracia said himself that using Rutter as a lone centre-forward was asking him to step out of his comfort zone.\\n\\nThe result is a footballer in the midst of a culture shock, trying to explain himself in a season that is beating the equilibrium out of everyone.\\n\\nMore often than not since promotion three years ago, Leeds\\u2019 transfer policy has been one of signings for tomorrow; potential preferred to hardened experience, with no outfield players aged 30 or over included in the agenda. The rules are not entirely hard and fast \\u2014 last summer seemed to put more emphasis on targets who had been around the block to a certain extent \\u2014 but Leeds don\\u2019t deal in finished articles.\\n\\nSometimes it has to be that way. Prime signings are too expensive or too expensive for the bracket of the market they are in. Younger players can appreciate in quality and price which enhances the team or allows for reinvestment.\\nLeeds United's recent struggles have highlighted the need for a talismanic player like Robert Snodgrass, who was heavily relied on during the club's poor seasons in the past. Though they have invested in Georginio Rutter, who cost the club \\u00a330million ($37.3m), the 20-year-old striker has failed to make a significant impact, having played just 234 minutes in the Premier League this season without registering a goal or assist. Leeds' transfer policy is focused on signing younger players who can appreciate in quality and price, but the team's current struggles suggest a need for more experienced players as well.\\nRaphinha was the model signing in that respect, although it is hard to know what possessed Rennes to sell him for \\u00a317million. But while the Brazilian had the sauce to turn it on in all weathers, the way in which transfers like his develop is generally linked to a club\\u2019s ability to stay stable in the interim. Emerging talent needs the freedom not to be rushed. There is, after all, a reason why Pep Guardiola took his time with Phil Foden.\\n\\nRutter fits into the overall theory of how Leeds see things: that somewhere in the future, people will be grateful that they took this route.\\n\\nFurther down the line, when it works and goes to plan, people will understand the thought process, appreciate the wisdom and ask why other clubs failed to think like they thought. One day you\\u2019ll be pleased that this was the strategy. But back in the real world, the Premier League does not afford the luxury of time.\\n\\nUltimately, the Premier League does not afford a club like Leeds the luxury of having a record signing who hardly plays.\\n\\nThe harsh reality is that while you think about tomorrow, the Premier League will find you today and as unfashionable as it might be, the here and now is not dispensable, which is why Snodgrass in the midst of broader struggles was worth his weight in gold. Three coaches struggling across two brutal seasons draws the very obvious conclusion that it cannot be all about them.\\n\\n _(Top photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)_\\nLeeds United's transfer strategy focuses on long-term development and emerging talent, but the Premier League demands results in the present. The success of signings like Raphinha and Jack Harrison relies on the stability of the club and the freedom to grow without being rushed. However, the harsh reality is that the Premier League does not afford the luxury of time, and a record signing who hardly plays is not sustainable. The hope is that in the future, people will appreciate Leeds' long-term thinking, but for now, results in the present must be prioritized.\"\n",

The club is in the driving seat for a seventh Premier League title under their current owners.</p><p>Abu Dhabi investors have also played a major role in redeveloping swathes of East Manchester. <a href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/3161148/2022/03/04/conflicted-misunderstood-dont-care-what-people-think-this-is-how-it-feels-to-be-city/\\\">Despite criticism of the Emirati ownership on human rights grounds</a> as well as <a href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/4160366/2023/02/06/manchester-city-financial-charges-explained/\\\">serious allegations about financial malpractice which the club denies</a>, the arrangement is generally viewed positively by local political and business leaders.</p><p>Though it may be difficult for United fans to admit it, it is not just the blue half of Manchester which is impressed at how areas like Ancoats and New Islington have been transformed over the past decade and a half.</p><p>\\u201cIt is viewed positively and enviously by those who think about these issues and see the utter absence of Glazer investment,\\u201d the insider said.</p><p>However, it is likely only Jassim\\u2019s bid would have the funds for such investment in the area beyond the stadium\\u2019s immediate surroundings. The insider added that given the huge amount of local investment on the table it is likely that representatives have had talks with local politicians. Others are adamant such conversations have not taken place.</p><hr><p>The Labour Party is almost completely dominant in Manchester, meaning contentious debates do not happen in newspaper pages or debating chambers like they do elsewhere.</p><p>\\u201cIn cities where politics happens out in public, you might expect strong statements from local leaders or even a bit of grandstanding,\\u201d says Joshi Hermann, founder and editor of The Mill, a news outlet covering Greater Manchester. \\u201cBut remember that in Manchester, most of the important politics is done behind closed doors. It\\u2019s a city of private dealmaking. More than ideology or principles or public brownie points, in Manchester, interests are king.</p><p>\\u201cI think the Manchester City ownership makes the idea of a Gulf owner taking over at United less controversial. People are used to the idea, even if there are still some persistent voices in the city who doggedly point out the terrible human rights record of the UAE.\\u201d</p><p>Abu Dhabi is part of the United Arab Emirates which has been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International points to arbitrary detention of dissidents while the UN\\u2019s Committee against Torture has voiced \\u201cconcern that reports received detail a pattern of torture and ill-treatment\\u201d. Criticism of Qatar has primarily focused on the treatment of migrant workers as well as the fact that homosexuality is illegal.</p><p>Hermann also points out that there is some controversy about the terms of the land deals struck between Manchester City Council and Manchester City\\u2019s owners, calling the secrecy of these deals \\u201cindefensible\\u201d. <a href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/3452661/2022/07/21/sale-of-public-land-to-manchester-city-owners-deemed-difficult-to-justify-by-researchers/\\\">A report by academics at Sheffield University last year said the council \\u201csold the family silver too cheap\\u201d and presided over a \\u201ctransfer of public wealth to private hands that is difficult to justify as prudent\\u201d</a>. Others point to gentrification and the pricing out of local residents at the expense of pricey new flats.</p><p>One of the streets near the Etihad Stadium is named after Sir Howard Bernstein, once chief executive of Manchester City Council, and closely associated with the city centre\\u2019s rebirth alongside Sir Richard Leese, who led the council for 25 years. Both were key figures in brokering deals between the council and Abu Dhabi investors.</p><p><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-4424458 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18095806/20230414_131449-scaled.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18095806/20230414_131449-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18095806/20230414_131449-300x135.jpg 300w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18095806/20230414_131449-1024x461.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18095806/20230414_131449-1536x691.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18095806/20230414_131449-2048x922.jpg 2048w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\\\"></p><p>Nevertheless, in private conversations with political insiders there is a strong consensus that the Abu Dhabi deals have benefited Manchester.</p><p>\\u201cIn cold pragmatic terms, and Manchester is a deeply pragmatic city, it seems to have been a success well beyond the football pitch,\\u201d says Hermann.</p><p>In private, people do not dispute the legitimate criticism over the secrecy of property deals or the awkwardness over the poor human rights record of the state to which this city and club have tied their modern identities. But it is tricky for politicians to publicly make their pragmatic argument \\u2014 that the ends justify the means.</p><p>The fact that the UK government has slashed budgets for local government over the past 13 years has only increased the appeal of such foreign investment.</p><hr><p>Since Mansour\\u2019s takeover in 2009, links between the council and Manchester City\\u2019s owners have deepened. In 2014 the Manchester Life regeneration project was announced as a joint venture between the council and the Abu Dhabi United Group, the vehicle through which Mansour owns Manchester City.</p><p>It is notable that while Labour politicians were queuing up to criticise <a class=\\\"ath_autolink\\\" href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/football/team/qatar/\\\">Qatar</a> during the World Cup last year, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham \\u2014 an outspoken voice on football issues \\u2014 had nothing to say on the matter. Like all Manchester politicians he is treading a careful line between welcoming foreign investment and giving ammunition to those concerned about money coming from the Gulf.</p><p>Speaking to a dozen or so fans outside Old Trafford ahead of the Sevilla match, it was striking how many not only had an opinion on the takeover but had a nuanced understanding of the relative merits of the two bids.</p><p>Foreign fans on social media have been vocally in favour of the Qatar bid while many match-going fans appreciate Sir Jim Ratcliffe\\u2019s local credentials, being born and raised just a few miles from Old Trafford.</p><p>However, there are also plenty of match-going fans who want Qatar to win out. One reason frequently cited is Jassim\\u2019s pledge to clear the club\\u2019s debt and invest in the stadium. City\\u2019s Etihad Stadium was chosen as north-west England\\u2019s representative in the UK-Ireland bid for the 2028 European Championships, with Old Trafford unable to guarantee that a new \\u201cstrategic masterplan\\u201d for the stadium will be ready in time.</p><p>\\u201cI think (the stadium) does need some work,\\u201d says\\u00a0a fan named\\u00a0Anthony Ravindrakumar, raising <a class=\\\"ath_autolink\\\" href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/football/player/cristiano-ronaldo-jh1IjFA8SnHLGtwM/\\\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>\\u2019s criticism of the fact that many of facilities were unchanged in the 12-year gap between his two stints at the club. \\u201cIt definitely needs a reboot \\u2014 Qatar will bring in new facilities and promised transfers.\\u201d</p><p>The Glazers have spent a huge sum on transfers over the last few years but in relative terms the club has fallen far behind given their domination on and off the pitch when Sir Alex Ferguson left the club a decade ago.</p><div id=\\\"attachment_4424338\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-caption-image-container\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-4424338 size-full\\\"

It then hit a low ebb in 1996 when a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army devastated a city centre where barely anybody lived.</p><p>Things have changed dramatically. The city centre now offers well-paid jobs and has become a desirable place to live and visit as a tourist. The boom in football tourism and success of the two local clubs has helped Manchester\\u2019s service industry, with hotels and restaurants seeing increased footfall when either side plays at home.</p><p>\\u201cManchester as a whole is in a much better place as a whole than it was 30 years ago,\\u201d says Breach, though he adds that there is still a lot of deprivation, especially outside the city\\u2019s thriving centre.

The other bid is from British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, founder of the Ineos petrochemicals.\\n\\nIn a statement at the time of the first bids, Jassim pledged to \\u201creturn the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch\\u201d by investing in the \\u201cthe football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience, and communities the club supports\\u201d.\\n\\nRatcliffe pledged to \\u201cput the Manchester back into Manchester United\\u201d by becoming \\u201clong-term custodians of Manchester United on behalf of the fans and the wider community\\u201d.\\n\\n _The Athletic_ spent time in the city either side of United\\u2019s 2-2 draw with Sevilla, during which fans lifted a banner saying \\u201cFull Sale Only\\u201d \\u2014 a response to gathering rumours that the Glazers may choose to stay in control and bring in new investment by selling a minority stake in the club.\\n\\nAmong those _The Athletic_ talked to were locals, fans and political insiders who all helped explain how the city, which has boomed over the past three decades, views the potentially huge change and the thorny political issues.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOld Trafford is in the council district of Trafford which lies just outside the boundaries of Manchester City Council. Both come under the umbrella of the Greater Manchester mayoralty.\\n\\nThe leaders of all three institutions declined to comment on the takeover. However _The Athletic_ has had many conversations with local political insiders on the basis of anonymity to protect relationships \\u2014 this is not an easy topic to speak about publicly.\\n\\nOne well-connected insider said people are keen to avoid taking sides on the takeover because they will have to work with whoever ends up owning the club, which could well still be the Glazer family.\\n\\nA point raised by many is that while criticism of human rights in Qatar became a big topic in the UK following last year\\u2019s World Cup, things feel different in Manchester, a city that has already been through the process of welcoming foreign capital from the Gulf into a local football team.\\n\\nIn 2009, Sheikh Mansour bought Manchester City and has overseen great success on the pitch. The club is in the driving seat for a seventh Premier League title under their current owners.\\n\\nAbu Dhabi investors have also played a major role in redeveloping swathes of East Manchester. Despite criticism of the Emirati ownership on human rights grounds as well as serious allegations about financial malpractice which the club denies, the arrangement is generally viewed positively by local political and business leaders.\\n\\nThough it may be difficult for United fans to admit it, it is not just the blue half of Manchester which is impressed at how areas like Ancoats and New Islington have been transformed over the past decade and a half.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is viewed positively and enviously by those who think about these issues and see the utter absence of Glazer investment,\\u201d the insider said.\\n\\nHowever, it is likely only Jassim\\u2019s bid would have the funds for such investment in the area beyond the stadium\\u2019s immediate surroundings. The insider added that given the huge amount of local investment on the table it is likely that representatives have had talks with local politicians. Others are adamant such conversations have not taken place.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe Labour Party is almost completely dominant in Manchester, meaning contentious debates do not happen in newspaper pages or debating chambers like they do elsewhere.\\n\\n\\u201cIn cities where politics happens out in public, you might expect strong statements from local leaders or even a bit of grandstanding,\\u201d says Joshi Hermann, founder and editor of The Mill, a news outlet covering Greater Manchester. \\u201cBut remember that in Manchester, most of the important politics is done behind closed doors. It\\u2019s a city of private dealmaking. More than ideology or principles or public brownie points, in Manchester, interests are king.\\n\\n\\u201cI think the Manchester City ownership makes the idea of a Gulf owner taking over at United less controversial. People are used to the idea, even if there are still some persistent voices in the city who doggedly point out the terrible human rights record of the UAE.\\u201d\\n\\nAbu Dhabi is part of the United Arab Emirates which has been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International points to arbitrary detention of dissidents while the UN\\u2019s Committee against Torture has voiced \\u201cconcern that reports received detail a pattern of torture and ill-treatment\\u201d. Criticism of Qatar has primarily focused on the treatment of migrant workers as well as the fact that homosexuality is illegal.\\n\\nHermann also points out that there is some controversy about the terms of the land deals struck between Manchester City Council and Manchester City\\u2019s owners, calling the secrecy of these deals \\u201cindefensible\\u201d. A report by academics at Sheffield University last year said the council \\u201csold the family silver too cheap\\u201d and presided over a \\u201ctransfer of public wealth to private hands that is difficult to justify as prudent\\u201d. Others point to gentrification and the pricing out of local residents at the expense of pricey new flats.\\n\\nOne of the streets near the Etihad Stadium is named after Sir Howard Bernstein, once chief executive of Manchester City Council, and closely associated with the city centre\\u2019s rebirth alongside Sir Richard Leese, who led the council for 25 years. Both were key figures in brokering deals between the council and Abu Dhabi investors.\\n\\nNevertheless, in private conversations with political insiders there is a strong consensus that the Abu Dhabi deals have benefited Manchester.\\n\\n\\u201cIn cold pragmatic terms, and Manchester is a deeply pragmatic city, it seems to have been a success well beyond the football pitch,\\u201d says Hermann.\\n\\nIn private, people do not dispute the legitimate criticism over the secrecy of property deals or the awkwardness over the poor human rights record of the state to which this city and club have tied their modern identities. But it is tricky for politicians to publicly make their pragmatic argument \\u2014 that the ends justify the means.\\n\\nThe fact that the UK government has slashed budgets for local government over the past 13 years has only increased the appeal of such foreign investment.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSince Mansour\\u2019s takeover in 2009, links between the council and Manchester City\\u2019s owners have deepened. In 2014 the Manchester Life regeneration project was announced as a joint venture between the council and the Abu Dhabi United Group, the vehicle through which Mansour owns Manchester City.\\n\\nIt is notable that while Labour politicians were queuing up to criticise Qatar during the World Cup last year, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham \\u2014 an outspoken voice on football issues \\u2014 had nothing to say on the matter. Like all Manchester politicians he is treading a careful line between welcoming foreign investment and giving ammunition to those concerned about money coming from the Gulf.\\n\\nSpeaking to a dozen or so fans outside Old Trafford ahead of the Sevilla match, it was striking how many not only had an opinion on the takeover but had a nuanced understanding of the relative merits of the two bids.\\n\\nForeign fans on social media have been vocally in favour of the Qatar bid while many match-going fans appreciate Sir Jim Ratcliffe\\u2019s local credentials, being born and raised just a few miles from Old Trafford.\\n\\nHowever, there are also plenty of match-going fans who want Qatar to win out. One reason frequently cited is Jassim\\u2019s pledge to clear the club\\u2019s debt and invest in the stadium. City\\u2019s Etihad Stadium was chosen as north-west England\\u2019s representative in the UK-Ireland bid for the 2028 European Championships, with Old Trafford unable to guarantee that a new \\u201cstrategic masterplan\\u201d for the stadium will be ready in time.\\n\\n\\u201cI think (the stadium) does need some work,\\u201d says a fan named Anthony Ravindrakumar, raising Cristiano Ronaldo\\u2019s criticism of the fact that many of facilities were unchanged in the 12-year gap between his two stints at the club. \\u201cIt definitely needs a reboot \\u2014 Qatar will bring in new facilities and promised transfers.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Glazers have spent a huge sum on transfers over the last few years but in relative terms the club has fallen far behind given their domination on and off the pitch when Sir Alex Ferguson left the club a decade ago.\\n\\nPictured left, Anthony Ravindrakumar\\n\\nMany fans also welcome the Qatari bid\\u2019s promise to wipe the club\\u2019s debt, a deeply toxic issue under the Glazers\\u2019 reign.\\n\\n\\u201cWanting an English owner is persuasive, but the Qataris will eradicate the debt,\\u201d says another fan, Luke Ionides, adding that the atmosphere at Old Trafford is \\u201cgreat\\u201d but the roof sometimes leaks under a heavy downpour. \\u201cIt could definitely use some investment.\\u201d\\n\\nHis brother Matthew says there would be some \\u201cpride\\u201d in having an English owner with local roots but also sees the appeal of Jassim\\u2019s pledge to eradicate debt.\\n\\nBoth are wary about United following Manchester City and Newcastle United as Premier League clubs associated with a Gulf monarchy, which raises the concept of \\u201csportswashing\\u201d and fans cheerleading a foreign state alongside their favourite players.\\n\\nJust as the embrace of Saudi owners by some Newcastle fans must be viewed through the context of replacing the despised Mike Ashley, there is a strong sense among United fans that anything would be better than the Glazers, even if it does raise awkward questions.\\n\\n\\u201cWe give our rivals stick for it and now we\\u2019re going to join them,\\u201d says Luke.\\n\\nThere was a firm feeling among everyone who spoke to _The Athletic_ that Jassim\\u2019s bid is the favourite, given his deeper pockets than Sir Jim Ratcliffe, though it is far from certain this will be the final outcome.\\n\\nLuke Ionides, left, and brother Matthew\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe UK is a country with a chronic shortage of housing yet it is often difficult to get anything built, with developments often objected to by those who see new buildings as a blot on the landscape or a drag on house prices. But revitalised Manchester \\u2014 a city where blue glass skyscrapers seem to pop up like daisies \\u2014 is different.\\n\\n\\u201cLike a lot of the other big cities (Manchester) has had this fall and then renaissance,\\u201d says Anthony Breach, a senior analyst at the Centre for Cities think tank. He explains that the city was the birthplace of the industrial revolution but struggled when industries like textiles declined after the Second World War. It then hit a low ebb in 1996 when a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army devastated a city centre where barely anybody lived.\\n\\nThings have changed dramatically. The city centre now offers well-paid jobs and has become a desirable place to live and visit as a tourist. The boom in football tourism and success of the two local clubs has helped Manchester\\u2019s service industry, with hotels and restaurants seeing increased footfall when either side plays at home.\\n\\n\\u201cManchester as a whole is in a much better place as a whole than it was 30 years ago,\\u201d says Breach, though he adds that there is still a lot of deprivation, especially outside the city\\u2019s thriving centre. He says Manchester\\u2019s next challenge is ensuring the suburbs share some of the economic gains.\\n\\n\\u201cThat might mean more development rather than less development,\\u201d he says.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe shabby streets around Old Trafford certainly feel a long way from the glitz of central Manchester.\\n\\n\\u201cManchester United is the biggest club in the world,\\u201d says Angelo, who owns the Red Star Supporters Shop on the small parade of shops just around the corner from the stadium. \\u201cPeople all over the world come here, it\\u2019s the Hollywood of world football, but you come here, you see garages here, you see empty, run-down buildings.\\u201d\\n\\nThe new owner needs to \\u201cdo the whole area up,\\u201d he says, saying the Qatari bid is his preference over Ratcliffe\\u2019s given the pledge to wipe the club\\u2019s debt.\\n\\nThe shabbiness of Old Trafford does not compare favourably to the Etihad Stadium, while the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is raised by several fans _The Athletic_ speaks to as something United should emulate \\u2014 with a hint of embarrassment, given United\\u2019s 20 league titles compared to Spurs\\u2019 two.\\n\\nSome argue a brand new stadium is the best solution, but others think a thorough revamp is the best way to move this club on from the glory days of the 1990s and 2000s into the modern age.\\n\\n\\u201cIt just needs doing up, everything needs doing up from scratch,\\u201d says Wes Carter who has been selling scarves outside Old Trafford since the 1980s. \\u201cIt\\u2019s tired. There\\u2019s holes in the roof and everything.\\u201d\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAs for where that money will ultimately come from, there is plenty of scepticism that making United the Premier League\\u2019s third club associated with a Gulf monarchy would be the right thing.\\n\\nOne reason these campaigns have had limited traction is it is seen as too late. The City and Newcastle takeovers have gone through and big money will be needed to compete with them in the long term.\\n\\nBut as well as that, Manchester has a particular local character which means resistance to Qatar is perhaps lighter than it might be elsewhere.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople who live in 21st-century Manchester are extremely familiar with the notion of foreign investors in general,\\u201d says Hermann of The Mill. \\u201cThe city\\u2019s recent property boom has been driven in large part by Hong Kong developers, Chinese construction firms and German pension funds.\\n\\n\\u201cYou could put dozens of flags on the buildings that are shooting up across our skyline. A Qatari tycoon wants to buy United and maybe develop some land around Old Trafford? It fits well within the model of Manchester\\u2019s recent growth, whether you like that or not.\\u201d\\n\\n _Additional reporting by Mark Critchley and Laurie Whitwell._\\n\\n _(Top photo: Stu Forster via Getty Images)_\\n\",\n",

The message said the bid from Sheikh Jassim was \\\"the best offer available to the club that will satisfy fans, staff and the local community\\\". However, there is no suggestion that the campaign was connected to Jassim's effort to buy the club, begun in February. The Glazer family, which owns Manchester United, has set an April 28 deadline for revised bids, with Jassim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe the only parties involved.\\u00a0\\nManchester is a \\\"city of private dealmaking\\\" where most important politics occur behind closed doors, according to Joshi Hermann, founder and editor of news outlet The Mill. In Manchester, interests are\\u00a0seen to be king rather than ideology, and debates about local politics do not take place in public. City and United footie fans have mixed opinions on who should take over at Old Trafford from the Glazer family, with concerns raised over human rights abuses\\u00a0in the United Arab Emirates and the use of public land for private gain among other issues.\\n\\nManchester United fans are eagerly watching the two rival bids for the club, with many welcoming the promise by Qatar's Jassim\\u00a0Al-Khelaifi to wipe the club\\u2019s debt. Though some have lingering reservations over foreign owners, ultimately for many United fans anything is better than the current Glazer regime. Manchester itself\\u00a0has undergone significant changes since the IRA bomb in 1996\\u00a0devastated the city but now it is increasingly being revitalised \\u2013 epitomised by\\u00a0the many blue glass skyscrapers. The city has\\u00a0largely bounced back with a strong service industry, with\\u00a0well-paid jobs and high levels of tourism attracted by the success of Manchester's clubs on the pitch. However, while the city centre is increasingly prosperous, there are ongoing issues with deprivation in the suburbs.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cPeople who live in 21st-century Manchester are extremely familiar with the notion of foreign investors in general,\\u201d says Hermann of The Mill. \\u201cThe city\\u2019s recent property boom has been driven in large part by Hong Kong developers, Chinese construction firms and German pension funds.\\n\\n\\u201cYou could put dozens of flags on the buildings that are shooting up across our skyline.

The city's skyline is now adorned with flags representing the nationalities of those who have invested in its developments. A Qatari tycoon's interest in buying Manchester United and developing land around Old Trafford is seen as fitting well within the city's growth model, whether or not it is to the liking of the locals.\"\n",

What I want is to try to play good, score goals,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat is tackles?\\u201d\\n\\nThose comments were ridiculed by many. Jamie Redknapp said it was \\u201cone of the most bizarre statements I have ever seen\\u201d. Stan Collymore called Guardiola \\u201cbeyond deluded\\u201d. Everything City have achieved in the years since has been a vindication of their manager\\u2019s methods \\u2014 that dominating possession is the most effective way to defend.\\n\\nBut dominating possession is not always possible. It may not be possible in this second leg. Sometimes you need tackles, blocks and interceptions. Sometimes even the best defensive side in the world is forced to defend differently.\\n\\n _(Top photo: Michael Zemanek/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)_\\n\",\n",

            "                    \"mini_summary\": \"You could make a convincing argument that Manchester City have been one of the best defensive sides in European football since Pep Guardiola\\u2019s appointment.\\n\\nIt may not always have felt like it, but the numbers speak for themselves. Only Atletico Madrid have conceded fewer goals per game in Europe\\u2019s major five leagues since the start of the 2016-17 season.\\n\\nThe case only grows stronger if looking at expected data, which has seen City rank as the best defence in Europe\\u2019s five major leagues in four of the past six years \\u2014 always coming out on top among Premier League clubs.\\n\\nEven this year, which includes that spell where Ederson kept conceding from the opposition\\u2019s first shot on target, City\\u2019s defence has given little away. Despite only having the 12th-best record across the continent\\u2019s top domestic leagues, they have the lowest xG conceded.\\n\\nOf all Guardiola\\u2019s title-winning sides, only one has not also boasted their league\\u2019s tightest or joint-tightest defence. And even then, in 2018-19 when runners-up Liverpool conceded just 22 goals, City conceded only 23 \\u2014 the fewest in a league season during Guardiola\\u2019s time in Manchester.\\n\\nWhen that impressive record was put to Guardiola last year, he was mischievously asked if this proved that he is a \\u2018defensive\\u2019 manager. \\u201cIn those terms, yes,\\u201d he replied with a chuckle.\\n\\n\\u201cWe defend with the ball. When you have the ball, that\\u2019s the best way to defend. To concede a goal, the opponent has to have the ball. The less of the ball they have, the more chance we have to get a clean sheet.\\u201d\\n\\nNathan Ake was superb for City in their first-leg victory against Bayern (Photo: James Gill \\u2013 Danehouse/Getty Images)\\n\\nIt is a simple premise \\u2014 football if you \\u2018explain it like I\\u2019m five\\u2019 \\u2014 but it has formed the defensive foundations of Guardiola\\u2019s managerial career. Keeping possession is not just about scoring goals, it\\u2019s about not conceding them, too. It is not nine-tenths of the law, it is the whole statute book.\\n\\nMaybe that is why, despite establishing a commanding lead against Bayern Munich last week, he walked into his post-match press conference \\u201cemotionally destroyed\\u201d.\\n\\nCity ended the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final tie with 44 per cent possession \\u2014 their second-lowest share in a match this season.\\n\\nAll that time spent without the ball meant Guardiola\\u2019s players had to make more tackles than they have in any other league or European game this campaign. Only once have they made more clearances. A back four that typically spends its evening standing on the halfway line was often seen camped on the edge of their own penalty area, if not deeper.\\n\\nYet, once the final whistle came, there were only plaudits for the excellent rearguard action. John Stones was named man of the match. Ruben Dias was imperious. Nathan Ake\\u2019s star continued to rise. Manuel Akanji\\u2019s performance was one of his best in a City shirt. It was a departure from how City usually defend but, aside from Jamal Musiala\\u2019s first-half shot that was blocked by Dias and several Leroy Sane sighters, Bayern were largely kept at arm\\u2019s length.\\n\\nWhat changed, then? For one, the physical profile of those doing the defending. It is a generalisation that Guardiola\\u2019s sides are packed with diminutive technicians in every position, but that is particularly untrue of this current City.\\n\\nHaving four natural centre-halves across the back helps. Bar Ake, every member of the back four that started against Bayern is six foot (183cm) or taller. Rodri, meanwhile, is taller than all of them. Look along the line and physically, it is more imposing and intimidating than any defence at the Etihad during the Guardiola era.\\n\\nAkanji wins the ball convincingly at the Etihad last week (Photo: MB Media/Getty Images)\\n\\nYet while City\\u2019s physicality was the most visually striking aspect of last week\\u2019s rearguard action, Guardiola was more impressed by their mentality.\\n\\n\\u201cThese four guys at the back, all the time 90 minutes, they are focused. They are incredibly stable here,\\u201d he said, pointing to his head. \\u201cThey have the ability to defend well but they are so stable here. They are there again and again.\\u201d\\n\\nThis side is not used to their opponents having the majority of the ball and it is even less used to them having it in dangerous positions. Bayern completed 32 final-third passes \\u2014 the joint-most of any side facing City this season. Each one had to be watched and weighed up, with focus and clarity of thought, and only dealt with once the time was right.\\nManchester City have a proven record of having one of the best defences in European football since Pep Guardiola\\u2019s appointment as manager, with only Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid conceding fewer goals per game in Europe's major five leagues since 2016-17. The team consistently ranks as the best defence in the major five leagues when taking into account expected data, and this season they have the lowest expected goals conceded. Guardiola\\u2019s approach is to defend by keeping possession of the ball and, despite typically enjoying more possession, City's defenders have shown themselves to be capable of holding off teams with their strong defensive mentality. Against Bayern Munich last week, City's back four spent much of the game standing on the edge of their penalty area or deeper, but their physicality and stability proved more than a match for Bayern.\\n\\u201cIn the Champions League, always there are moments you have to defend well one against one in the final third and win duels,\\u201d Guardiola said when reflecting on City\\u2019s defending against Bayern a few days later. \\u201cDon\\u2019t be anxious, don\\u2019t be nervous about what\\u2019s going to happen. That depends on the mental approach of the defenders we have.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd yet as well as City defended \\u2014 for all the praise that has rightly come the back four\\u2019s way \\u2014 Guardiola still entered that post-match press conference frazzled.\\n\\nHe has since admitted this was not precisely the way City set out to play. He has stressed that, on another day, things could have gone differently. \\u201cI had the feeling that other teams in previous seasons had less chances than Munich and scored more goals,\\u201d he said immediately after last week\\u2019s first leg.\\n\\nCity did not sit back and soak up pressure for long spells out of choice but out of necessity. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to be defending deep,\\u201d Guardiola later said. Bayern\\u2019s quality forced them to. \\u201cWe had to do it against Bayern because they were effective, but the principle to go high and take the ball was always there.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd, tellingly, Guardiola admitted he would have preferred to see his side have more possession. Why? \\u201cBecause always I believe the more of the ball you have, the less actions the opponent will have.\\u201d\\n\\nAs impressive as City\\u2019s performance in the first leg was, it ran contrary to that defining principle of Guardiola\\u2019s success: that whoever controls the battle for possession controls the game. A similar pattern of play in the second leg could produce a different outcome.\\n\\nBayern are the side in Europe\\u2019s major five leagues closest to matching City\\u2019s near two-thirds domination of possession domestically. Even while accounting for the gap in competitiveness and quality between the Premier League and the Bundesliga, City could easily spend most of their evening at the Allianz Arena on the back foot.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a team in Germany that after 34 games they have more possession, more chances, more opportunities than the opponent,\\u201d Guardiola said last Friday. \\u201cDoes that mean they\\u2019re going to win, not lose? No, they dropped points this season, but they have more and more than the other ones.\\u201d\\n\\nBayern are \\u201cbuilt\\u201d to dominate, he said. \\u201cFor the history, for the shirt, for many things. That\\u2019s why I knew (they could have more possession in the first leg).\\u201d City will try to keep the ball \\u201cbetter in the second leg\\u201d, he admitted. His preference is always for his side to be a game\\u2019s protagonists, but there is every chance they will not be.\\n\\nAnd so despite the commanding 3-0 lead, he believes there is still a tie to be won. At least, judging by the first leg, City are now better prepared for those rare occasions when they do not have it all their own way.\\n\\nGuardiola gets his message across in the 3-0 trouncing of the German giants (Photo: Dave Howarth \\u2013 CameraSport via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe outlier season in Guardiola\\u2019s exemplary defensive record as a manager is his first year at City, with 39 goals conceded in the league \\u2014 the only time one of his sides has let in more than a goal a game domestically. That year, after a 4-2 defeat at Leicester, he was asked whether he was unhappy with how few tackles his players won.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not a coach for the tackles. I don\\u2019t train tackles. What I want is to try to play good, score goals,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat is tackles?\\u201d\\n\\nThose comments were ridiculed by many. Jamie Redknapp said it was \\u201cone of the most bizarre statements I have ever seen\\u201d. Stan Collymore called Guardiola \\u201cbeyond deluded\\u201d. Everything City have achieved in the years since has been a vindication of their manager\\u2019s methods \\u2014 that dominating possession is the most effective way to defend.\\n\\nBut dominating possession is not always possible. It may not be possible in this second leg. Sometimes you need tackles, blocks and interceptions. Sometimes even the best defensive side in the world is forced to defend differently.\\n\\n _(Top photo: Michael Zemanek/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)_\\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has revealed his side enjoyed less possession of the ball against Bayern Munich during the Champions League quarterfinal's first leg due to the German side's effectiveness. Although City's defence has been praised, the team were forced to defend deep during the match against Bayern, according to Guardiola. He added that he would have preferred to see his team have more possession. The outlet suggests that, despite City's 3-0 win in the first leg, Bayern may enjoy more possession in the second leg \\u2014 and Guardiola said that sometimes \\\"even the best defensive team in the world is forced to defend differently\\\".\"\n",

Such a contest has happened only 10 times in Ligue 1 since the turn of the century.</p><p>But when Christophe Galtier sat down to face the media last week before Paris Saint-Germain\\u2019s meeting with RC Lens, he was well aware there was more than just a league title at stake.</p><p>The auditorium at the Camp des Loges was packed out, with more journalists and photographers than normal. Galtier entered the room and sat under the spotlight, alongside the club\\u2019s head of sports communication Julien Maynard. They each had a sheet of paper in front of them, pre-prepared statements that underlined why the week\\u2019s preparations for an important match had been thrown into turmoil.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Galtier\\u2019s career and reputation were put on the line. Serious allegations were levied at the <a class=\\\"ath_autolink\\\" href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/football/team/paris-saint-germain/\\\">PSG</a> head coach, who stood accused of using racist and insulting remarks about his own players when in charge of Nice last season. They are accusations he has denied, and he would reiterate in that press conference that he will take legal action against those who are \\u201cdamaging my reputation\\u201d.</p><p>But the allegations are of a significant nature and they have dominated the sports bulletins in France, threatening to cast a shadow over the 56-year-old unless he can clear his name. A legal investigation has begun, with a police search conducted at Nice\\u2019s training ground last week. For now, though, Galtier is at the mercy of the court of public opinion.</p><p>Here is the background to L\\u2019Affaire Galtier, and why it has caused a stir in the French capital.</p><h2><strong>What happened?\\u00a0</strong></h2><p>The tension at the Allianz Riviera Stadium was palpable on the terraces well before kick-off. On Saturday, April 8, Galtier returned to Nice for the first time since he left for PSG last summer. When his name was read out in the stadium pre-match, the home fans whistled furiously. During the game, they unveiled a banner accompanied by insulting chants regarding Galtier\\u2019s mother.</p><p>At full-time, Galtier reacted, storming towards the Nice ultras to sarcastically applaud them, and then revealed to the media that his mother is recovering from cancer. It was all extremely unsavoury. But discord was not entirely unexpected.</p><div id=\\\"attachment_4424287\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-caption-image-container\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-4424287 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18090404/GettyImages-1480861892-scaled.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18090404/GettyImages-1480861892-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18090404/GettyImages-1480861892-300x179.jpg 300w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18090404/GettyImages-1480861892-1024x612.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18090404/GettyImages-1480861892-1536x918.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18090404/GettyImages-1480861892-2048x1224.jpg 2048w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\\\"><div class=\\\"inline-credits\\\"><div class=\\\"inline-credits-container\\\">\\n      <span class=\\\"table-cell-span\\\"><p class=\\\"credits-image\\\" data-rjs=\\\"\\\"></p></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"credits-text\\\">Galtier was unhappy at the end of PSG\\u2019s game at Nice and marched towards the away fans to confront them at full-time after they displayed a banner about his mother (Photo by Xavier Laine/Getty Images)</span></div></div></div></div><p>There was tension in the game anyway for Galtier, considering PSG\\u2019s back-to-back defeats, but there was a back story that had stirred in Nice and would not be allowed to be forgotten. It was well known that there had been a rupture between Galtier and then director of football at Nice, Julien Fournier, during his time in charge of the club. They fell out and tensions were known to have piqued at the club during Ramadan last year.</p><p>But in September, after both had left Nice, Fournier said this on radio station RMC: \\u201cVery honestly, if I explain the real reasons why Christophe and I had a fight \\u2014 because that\\u2019s the word \\u2014 he will no longer enter a locker room in France and Europe.\\u201d</p><p>That same month, <a href=\\\"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Fournier-galtier-les-coulisses-d-un-clash/1356720\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">L\\u2019Equipe</a> reported further details \\u2014 going beyond disputes over recruitment. They outlined claims Galtier had voiced displeasure at the make-up of his squad, and then, during Ramadan in April, said there was further tension as Galtier tried to persuade his Muslim players not to fast. Nice\\u2019s season reflected this change in atmosphere, as the club dropped from a <a class=\\\"ath_autolink\\\" href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/football/champions-league/\\\">Champions League</a> spot to fifth and lost the Coupe de France final. At that time, Galtier had denied the accusations and pointed to years of working in diverse dressings rooms.</p><p>In the summer of 2022, both Fournier and Galtier, whose relationship had deteriorated, would leave the club. Galtier was recruited by PSG, and Fournier, after more than a decade spent at Nice, left the club, citing \\u201cstrategic differences\\u201d.</p><p>Since then, more layers were added to the story. Former Nice player <a class=\\\"ath_autolink\\\" href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/football/player/mario-lemina-jJbFTfJwWuY0VxAu/\\\">Mario Lemina</a>, who was one of the Muslim members of the squad, intimated that not all was well in the final six months of the season at Nice in an interview with YouTube channel <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqri9qIasiM&amp;ab_channel=Colinterview-OhMyGoal\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Colinterview</a>, in January.</p><p>\\u201cWe know what happened,\\u201d he said. \\u201cInternally, we know everything that happened. I wouldn\\u2019t be able to tell you what happened at the club over the last six months, because it\\u2019s a total lack of understanding. I still can\\u2019t figure out why things happened like this. It was hard. Frankly, this period was difficult because you cannot go from six months of \\u2018everything is fine\\u2019 to six months of total lack of understanding.\\u201d</p><p>On the day of PSG\\u2019s game with Nice earlier this month, the <a href=\\\"https://www.nicematin.com/football/avant-ogc-nice-psg-retour-sur-la-saison-nicoise-de-christophe-galtier-entre-conflits-et-reussite-839989?utm_content=link&amp;utm_term=Nice_Matin&amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;utm_source=nonli&amp;utm_medium=Social%20media\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">newspaper Nice Matin</a> outlined that Galtier, as Nice coach, had asked his players not to fast during Ramadan. While some of his squad were said to have accepted, the request was reportedly rejected by Hicham Boudaoui and Jean-Clair Todibo \\u2014 the latter was reported to have thrown a cone during a training session. It also detailed that Galtier had no relationship with reserve coach Didier Digard, who is now in charge of the first team.</p><p>Then, on Tuesday last week, Fournier\\u2019s apparent \\u201creasons\\u201d against Galtier came to light.</p><p>Journalist <a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/NqOqvknlg10\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Romain Molina</a>, and then <a href=\\\"https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/ligue-1/nice-les-graves-accusations-de-julien-four%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dier-dans-un-mail-envoye-a-sa-direction_AV-202304110782.html\\\">RMC\\u2019s After Foot</a> programme, published an alleged email, purportedly sent by Fournier to Sir Dave Brailsford, a British director of sport at INEOS, the petrochemicals giant that owns Nice.</p><p>Within that email, serious allegations were made against Galtier and his son and agent, John Valovic-Galtier.</p><a href=\\\"https://theathletic.com/4394041/2023/04/09/galtier-psg-nice-messi-paris-saint-germain/\\\" class=\\\"go-deeper\\\"><div class=\\\"go-deeper\\\"><div><p class=\\\"go-deeper-label\\\">GO DEEPER</p><p class=\\\"go-deeper-title\\\">Galtier, rage and a reprieve as PSG get back to winning ways</p></div></div></a><h2><strong>What were the accusations?</strong></h2><p>In the reported email, several allegations were made against Galtier, including that he said he \\u201ccould not have so many blacks and Muslims in the team\\u201d. Valovic-Galtier was also implicated over allegedly making racist and insulting remarks.</p><p>The email, which <em>The Athletic</em> has not verified, is reported to have described meetings between Fournier and Galtier, and Fournier and Valovic-Galtier, during the 2021-22 season.</p><p>It alleges, according to the reporting of Molina and RMC, that Valovic-Galtier had stated to Fournier that his father and client was upset because Fournier \\u201chad built a team of scum\\u201c which did not reflect Galtier, and that \\u201cthere are only blacks, and half the team are at the mosque on Friday afternoon\\u201d.</p><p>It further alleges that Galtier said to Fournier the team did not reflect the city, adding that he visited a restaurant in Nice where \\u201ceveryone came up to say that we have a team of blacks\\u201d. It also alleges that Galtier had wished to reduce the number of Muslims in the team, including \\u201cTodibo, (Youcef) Atal, Boudaoui, (Amine) Gouiri, Lemina\\u201d and that he did not want to sign Ozan Kabak because he was a Muslim. The Ramadan period was described as affording Galtier \\u201cthe opportunity to complain continuously about the fact that \\u2018we had too many Muslim players in the team\\u2019\\u201d.</p><p>In the email, Fournier alleges that all of this information had been relayed to Bob Ratcliffe, the brother of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and then chairman of the supervisory board at the club.</p><h2><strong>What have PSG, Nice and Galtier said so far?</strong></h2><p>Galtier, through a statement given to AFP by his lawyer, Olivier Martin, denied the accusations, contesting them with \\u201cthe greatest firmness\\u201d and added that legal action would follow. That legal action will see a complaint filed for defamation against Fournier, Molina and journalist Daniel Riolo, of RMC. A further complaint will be made regarding harassment, owing to the high number of threats \\u2014 including death threats \\u2014 that Galtier and his family have received since the allegations resurfaced. The PSG coach\\u2019s phone number was leaked online and he and his family have since had to be given added personal protection.</p><p>Last week, Galtier articulated his denial in public for the first time, making a pre-prepared statement at the start of Friday\\u2019s pre-match press conference.</p><p>\\u201cI am deeply shocked by the comments attributed to me and which have been relayed by some in an irresponsible way,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey hit me in the depths of my humanity. I am a child of a low-income housing estate, raised in diversity, and the values \\u200b\\u200bof sharing and respect for others, whatever their origin, colour or religion. My whole life as a man, as a footballer and then as a coach, has been dictated by the concern for, and sharing and living well with, others.</p><p>\\u201cI cannot accept that my name and my family be sullied in this way. I therefore have decided to take legal action against anyone who harms my reputation. I can only be satisfied with the opening of a legal investigation. I have confidence in the justice system of my country. In order to allow justice to follow its course, I will not make any further comments on this subject. Paris Saint-Germain have a very important match to play this Saturday. All my energy and my concentration are turned towards this objective.\\u201d</p><p>Paris Saint-Germain also made a statement at the start of the press conference:\\u00a0\\u201cSerious allegations have been made in the media against our coach Christophe Galtier. Christophe responded clearly by firmly denying them and announcing that he was going to take legal action. The club supports Christophe Galtier after the numerous and unacceptable threats he has received and now wants the truth to be established by justice.</p><p>\\u201cWhile waiting for the conclusion of the judicial process, and in order to protect the safety of all, the club calls on everyone to take responsibility and to calm down. Paris Saint-Germain, the board, its players and all employees, have no tolerance for discrimination on or off the pitch. The fight against racism and all forms of discrimination is a fundamental commitment of the club. Paris Saint-Germain will not be troubled by this episode, and everyone remains fully focused on tomorrow\\u2019s match.\\u201d</p><p>Nice also made a statement: \\u201cThe facts related concern two people who no longer work for OGC Nice. This situation was treated with the utmost seriousness at the time of the events. The club will not comment further.\\u201d</p><p>Fournier denied being the source of the leak. In a statement given to Nice Matin, he said: \\u201cI am currently in Brazil, far from this controversy with which I am associated at my expense. I am in no way responsible for the dissemination of this year-old internal information at the time of my departure from the club.</p><p>\\u201cI have never kicked someone when they are down, despite all our differences with Christophe Galtier, and above all I have too much respect for OGC Nice, a club whose colours I proudly defended for more than 10 years and the people in place, who are currently preparing for one of the most important meetings in their history in the European Cup (Europa Conference League). The timing of these revelations revolts me as much as their content.\\u201d</p><div class=\\\"c-message_kit__blocks c-message_kit__blocks--rich_text\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"c-message__message_blocks c-message__message_blocks--rich_text\\\" data-qa=\\\"message-text\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"p-block_kit_renderer\\\" data-qa=\\\"block-kit-renderer\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"p-rich_text_block\\\" dir=\\\"auto\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"p-rich_text_section\\\">INEOS did not wish to comment due to ongoing legal proceedings.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div><p>Valovic-Galtier reportedly denied the claims on his private Instagram account. \\u201cThank you all for your support,\\u201d he wrote.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe accusations against me are false and intolerable. They will not go unanswered.\\u201d</p><h2><strong>What is being investigated \\u2014 and who by?</strong></h2><p>On Friday, the public prosecutor for Nice, Xavier Bonhomme, confirmed a preliminary investigation had been opened on the \\u201cgrounds of discrimination based on alleged race or belonging to religion\\u201d, and that \\u201ca police search was under way at the premises of OGC Nice\\u201d.</p><p>Despite reports to the contrary, Paris Saint-Germain have not opened an internal investigation into the case. Internally, there is a feeling at PSG that the allegations were first denied months ago and that the new developments may have been brought up because of Galtier\\u2019s precarious position, in the wake of a poor run of form in the league. They have continued to support Galtier, noting the legal action he is taking.</p><p>As seen above, Nice, in their statement, refer to dealing with the situation with the \\u201cutmost seriousness\\u201d last summer.</p><div id=\\\"attachment_4424138\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-caption-image-container\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-4424138 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18080528/GettyImages-1249879448-scaled.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18080528/GettyImages-1249879448-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18080528/GettyImages-1249879448-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18080528/GettyImages-1249879448-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18080528/GettyImages-1249879448-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/18080528/GettyImages-1249879448-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\\\"><div class=\\\"inline-credits\\\"><div class=\\\"inline-credits-container\\\">\\n      <span class=\\\"table-cell-span\\\"><p class=\\\"credits-image\\\" data-rjs=\\\"\\\"></p></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"credits-text\\\">Didier Digard has been in charge of Nice since Lucien Favre was sacked in January (Photo: VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images)</span></div></div></div></div><p>\\u201cI had said that two versions clashed and that the truth was going to come out,\\u201d said Nice caretaker manager Digard on Saturday. \\u201cI was not taking sides. I remained very straight in my statement. Now, it\\u2019s good for us that justice has been seized, we have the certainty that a truth will come out and at that time we may be able to express ourselves, but not until then. That there is a preliminary investigation? It\\u2019s great, sincerely, otherwise it\\u2019s the public tribunal, and it\\u2019s terrible.</p><p>\\u201cThese cases \\u2014 the problem is they affect families, and when they affect families, it tires a little more than football. Me, it\\u2019s football that I like. If we have to talk about religion, I will never talk about it in public.\\u201d</p><h2><strong>What has the public reaction been?\\u00a0</strong></h2><p>There has been a shocked reaction in France, and the developments have made headlines. But there has also been caution. It remains a case of one side\\u2019s word against another. One of Paris Saint-Germain\\u2019s leading supporters\\u2019 groups, the Collectif Ultras Paris, called for Galtier to leave the club if he is found guilty of making the alleged remarks.</p><p>Galtier has received public support from several former players, coaches and colleagues, particularly from those who had worked with him at his previous clubs, including Lille, Saint-Etienne and Sochaux, the latter where he was assistant.</p><p>That includes public support from Jose Fonte, who worked under Galtier during his title-winning season at Lille in 2020-21, Mevlut Erding, the former PSG, Saint-Etienne and Sochaux player, former Sochaux player Fousseni Diawara, ex-Saint-Etienne sports director Damien Comolli and Saint-Etienne chairman Roland Romeyer, among others.</p><p>Burak Yilmaz, who is a Muslim and played under Galtier at Lille in 2020-21, wrote on Instagram: \\u201cI read the news today and I felt I had to say something. I worked with Galtier and never felt negative behaviour on his part because of my religion or my nationality. He is a great coach as much as a great person.\\u201d</p><p>Ismael Diomande, who worked with Galtier throughout his time as a coach at Saint-Etienne between,\\u00a0 told L\\u2019Equipe he was surprised by the news, adding: \\u201cI am a Muslim and I never had any problems with him. And I was not the only Muslim in the group. Whoever wanted to do Ramadan could do it, whoever didn\\u2019t want to do it didn\\u2019t. On the racism side: frankly, I was surprised because I never had any problems with him. As a human, it\\u2019s someone good, I keep a positive image of the man.\\u201c</p><p>Brest coach Eric Roy, who played with Galtier at Marseille in 1996-97 and worked with Fournier at Nice, spoke to the media in a press conference before his side\\u2019s match with Nice at the weekend. He said: \\u201cIf Galtier was racist, we would have known about it for a long time. You don\\u2019t spend 30 years in dressing rooms without having a label. Knowing the two characters, I will therefore put more doubt on the whistleblower than on Galtier.\\u201d</p><h2><strong>How have the players and staff responded at PSG and Nice?\\u00a0</strong></h2><p>Galtier claimed in his press conference that he had not spoken with his players about the subject. \\u201cBut they have given me the best response by the way they have been training so far,\\u201d he said. PSG beat Lens 3-1 to strengthen their hand in the Ligue 1 title race.</p><p>A source close to the squad, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect their relationships, suggested, like many people, that they are waiting for clarity and what transpires from any new investigation.</p><p>At Nice, there has been limited discussion of the topic. Other than Digard\\u2019s remarks in press conferences, no one else has spoken out about the claims. The timing of these new developments for the club \\u2014 like for Galtier at a moment of his vulnerability amid pressure at PSG \\u2014 was not ideal. They emerged two days before the first leg of their Europa Conference League last-16 tie with FC Basel, arguably their biggest match of the season. They would draw in Basel, but lost to Brest on Sunday.</p><p>Speaking as a pundit for Amazon Prime on Sunday, Thierry Henry criticised the silence from Nice.</p><p>\\u201cThere is someone who must speak, more than these three lines that we have seen recently (in a press release),\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere must be someone who must come and explain to us what happened. Yes, I know it happened with two people who are no longer at the club, but we are talking about your club, your institution anyway.</p><p>\\u201cI need to hear what happened on the other side\\u201d.</p><h2><strong>What next for Galtier?</strong></h2><p>Victory over Lens offered another small on-field reprieve for Galtier. Defeat would have seen Lens reduce the gap to three points at the top of the table. But now, with an eight-point lead over new chasers Marseille and a favourable run-in ahead, PSG remain on course to win a record 11th league title.</p><p>After the victory over Lens, Galtier publicly thanked club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Luis Campos for their support.</p><p>But his position\\u00a0long term\\u00a0is by no means safe,\\u00a0owing to matters on the field. PSG have long since had the intention of holding on to Galtier until the season has concluded. However, the expectation remains that Galtier, who has one year left on his contract, will likely depart in the summer having failed to deliver Champions League success.</p><p>When Galtier took the job, he would have been well aware of the scrutiny that comes with being PSG manager. That is the nature of the task. But the way 2023 has unfolded for the coach, a job that was once a dream has descended into a nightmare. As Le Parisien surmised this week, it has been an \\u201cannus horribilis\\u201d for Galtier. And it is difficult to see the light.</p><p>\\u201cWhen you prepare to become coach of PSG, you know that were will be pressure, comments, analysis criticism,\\u201d he said on Friday. \\u201cBut this is something away from sport.

            "                    \"summary\": \"A season\\u2019s work can often be defined by a top-of-the-table encounter and that is particularly true when it comes to _un choc_ \\u2014 a game between first against second in the league table \\u2014 after 30 league games. Such a contest has happened only 10 times in Ligue 1 since the turn of the century.\\n\\nBut when Christophe Galtier sat down to face the media last week before Paris Saint-Germain\\u2019s meeting with RC Lens, he was well aware there was more than just a league title at stake.\\n\\nThe auditorium at the Camp des Loges was packed out, with more journalists and photographers than normal. Galtier entered the room and sat under the spotlight, alongside the club\\u2019s head of sports communication Julien Maynard. They each had a sheet of paper in front of them, pre-prepared statements that underlined why the week\\u2019s preparations for an important match had been thrown into turmoil.\\n\\nLast Tuesday, Galtier\\u2019s career and reputation were put on the line. Serious allegations were levied at the PSG head coach, who stood accused of using racist and insulting remarks about his own players when in charge of Nice last season. They are accusations he has denied, and he would reiterate in that press conference that he will take legal action against those who are \\u201cdamaging my reputation\\u201d.\\n\\nBut the allegations are of a significant nature and they have dominated the sports bulletins in France, threatening to cast a shadow over the 56-year-old unless he can clear his name. A legal investigation has begun, with a police search conducted at Nice\\u2019s training ground last week. For now, though, Galtier is at the mercy of the court of public opinion.\\n\\nHere is the background to L\\u2019Affaire Galtier, and why it has caused a stir in the French capital.\\n\\n##  **What happened?**\\n\\nThe tension at the Allianz Riviera Stadium was palpable on the terraces well before kick-off. On Saturday, April 8, Galtier returned to Nice for the first time since he left for PSG last summer. When his name was read out in the stadium pre-match, the home fans whistled furiously. During the game, they unveiled a banner accompanied by insulting chants regarding Galtier\\u2019s mother.\\n\\nAt full-time, Galtier reacted, storming towards the Nice ultras to sarcastically applaud them, and then revealed to the media that his mother is recovering from cancer. It was all extremely unsavoury. But discord was not entirely unexpected.\\n\\nGaltier was unhappy at the end of PSG\\u2019s game at Nice and marched towards the away fans to confront them at full-time after they displayed a banner about his mother (Photo by Xavier Laine/Getty Images)\\n\\nThere was tension in the game anyway for Galtier, considering PSG\\u2019s back-to-back defeats, but there was a back story that had stirred in Nice and would not be allowed to be forgotten. It was well known that there had been a rupture between Galtier and then director of football at Nice, Julien Fournier, during his time in charge of the club. They fell out and tensions were known to have piqued at the club during Ramadan last year.\\n\\nBut in September, after both had left Nice, Fournier said this on radio station RMC: \\u201cVery honestly, if I explain the real reasons why Christophe and I had a fight \\u2014 because that\\u2019s the word \\u2014 he will no longer enter a locker room in France and Europe.\\u201d\\n\\nThat same month, L\\u2019Equipe reported further details \\u2014 going beyond disputes over recruitment. They outlined claims Galtier had voiced displeasure at the make-up of his squad, and then, during Ramadan in April, said there was further tension as Galtier tried to persuade his Muslim players not to fast. Nice\\u2019s season reflected this change in atmosphere, as the club dropped from a Champions League spot to fifth and lost the Coupe de France final. At that time, Galtier had denied the accusations and pointed to years of working in diverse dressings rooms.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2022, both Fournier and Galtier, whose relationship had deteriorated, would leave the club. Galtier was recruited by PSG, and Fournier, after more than a decade spent at Nice, left the club, citing \\u201cstrategic differences\\u201d.\\n\\nSince then, more layers were added to the story. Former Nice player Mario Lemina, who was one of the Muslim members of the squad, intimated that not all was well in the final six months of the season at Nice in an interview with YouTube channel Colinterview, in January.\\n\\n\\u201cWe know what happened,\\u201d he said. \\u201cInternally, we know everything that happened. I wouldn\\u2019t be able to tell you what happened at the club over the last six months, because it\\u2019s a total lack of understanding. I still can\\u2019t figure out why things happened like this. It was hard. Frankly, this period was difficult because you cannot go from six months of \\u2018everything is fine\\u2019 to six months of total lack of understanding.\\u201d\\n\\nOn the day of PSG\\u2019s game with Nice earlier this month, the newspaper Nice Matin outlined that Galtier, as Nice coach, had asked his players not to fast during Ramadan. While some of his squad were said to have accepted, the request was reportedly rejected by Hicham Boudaoui and Jean-Clair Todibo \\u2014 the latter was reported to have thrown a cone during a training session. It also detailed that Galtier had no relationship with reserve coach Didier Digard, who is now in charge of the first team.\\n\\nThen, on Tuesday last week, Fournier\\u2019s apparent \\u201creasons\\u201d against Galtier came to light.\\n\\nJournalist Romain Molina, and then RMC\\u2019s After Foot programme, published an alleged email, purportedly sent by Fournier to Sir Dave Brailsford, a British director of sport at INEOS, the petrochemicals giant that owns Nice.\\n\\nWithin that email, serious allegations were made against Galtier and his son and agent, John Valovic-Galtier.\\n\\nGO DEEPER\\n\\nGaltier, rage and a reprieve as PSG get back to winning ways\\n\\n##  **What were the accusations?**\\n\\nIn the reported email, several allegations were made against Galtier, including that he said he \\u201ccould not have so many blacks and Muslims in the team\\u201d. Valovic-Galtier was also implicated over allegedly making racist and insulting remarks.\\n\\nThe email, which _The Athletic_ has not verified, is reported to have described meetings between Fournier and Galtier, and Fournier and Valovic-Galtier, during the 2021-22 season.\\n\\nIt alleges, according to the reporting of Molina and RMC, that Valovic-Galtier had stated to Fournier that his father and client was upset because Fournier \\u201chad built a team of scum\\u201c which did not reflect Galtier, and that \\u201cthere are only blacks, and half the team are at the mosque on Friday afternoon\\u201d.\\n\\nIt further alleges that Galtier said to Fournier the team did not reflect the city, adding that he visited a restaurant in Nice where \\u201ceveryone came up to say that we have a team of blacks\\u201d. It also alleges that Galtier had wished to reduce the number of Muslims in the team, including \\u201cTodibo, (Youcef) Atal, Boudaoui, (Amine) Gouiri, Lemina\\u201d and that he did not want to sign Ozan Kabak because he was a Muslim. The Ramadan period was described as affording Galtier \\u201cthe opportunity to complain continuously about the fact that \\u2018we had too many Muslim players in the team\\u2019\\u201d.\\n\\nIn the email, Fournier alleges that all of this information had been relayed to Bob Ratcliffe, the brother of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and then chairman of the supervisory board at the club.\\n\\n##  **What have PSG, Nice and Galtier said so far?**\\n\\nGaltier, through a statement given to AFP by his lawyer, Olivier Martin, denied the accusations, contesting them with \\u201cthe greatest firmness\\u201d and added that legal action would follow. That legal action will see a complaint filed for defamation against Fournier, Molina and journalist Daniel Riolo, of RMC. A further complaint will be made regarding harassment, owing to the high number of threats \\u2014 including death threats \\u2014 that Galtier and his family have received since the allegations resurfaced. The PSG coach\\u2019s phone number was leaked online and he and his family have since had to be given added personal protection.\\n\\nLast week, Galtier articulated his denial in public for the first time, making a pre-prepared statement at the start of Friday\\u2019s pre-match press conference.\\n\\n\\u201cI am deeply shocked by the comments attributed to me and which have been relayed by some in an irresponsible way,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey hit me in the depths of my humanity. I am a child of a low-income housing estate, raised in diversity, and the values \\u200b\\u200bof sharing and respect for others, whatever their origin, colour or religion. My whole life as a man, as a footballer and then as a coach, has been dictated by the concern for, and sharing and living well with, others.\\n\\n\\u201cI cannot accept that my name and my family be sullied in this way. I therefore have decided to take legal action against anyone who harms my reputation. I can only be satisfied with the opening of a legal investigation. I have confidence in the justice system of my country. In order to allow justice to follow its course, I will not make any further comments on this subject. Paris Saint-Germain have a very important match to play this Saturday. All my energy and my concentration are turned towards this objective.\\u201d\\n\\nParis Saint-Germain also made a statement at the start of the press conference: \\u201cSerious allegations have been made in the media against our coach Christophe Galtier. Christophe responded clearly by firmly denying them and announcing that he was going to take legal action. The club supports Christophe Galtier after the numerous and unacceptable threats he has received and now wants the truth to be established by justice.\\n\\n\\u201cWhile waiting for the conclusion of the judicial process, and in order to protect the safety of all, the club calls on everyone to take responsibility and to calm down. Paris Saint-Germain, the board, its players and all employees, have no tolerance for discrimination on or off the pitch. The fight against racism and all forms of discrimination is a fundamental commitment of the club. Paris Saint-Germain will not be troubled by this episode, and everyone remains fully focused on tomorrow\\u2019s match.\\u201d\\n\\nNice also made a statement: \\u201cThe facts related concern two people who no longer work for OGC Nice. This situation was treated with the utmost seriousness at the time of the events. The club will not comment further.\\u201d\\n\\nFournier denied being the source of the leak. In a statement given to Nice Matin, he said: \\u201cI am currently in Brazil, far from this controversy with which I am associated at my expense. I am in no way responsible for the dissemination of this year-old internal information at the time of my departure from the club.\\n\\n\\u201cI have never kicked someone when they are down, despite all our differences with Christophe Galtier, and above all I have too much respect for OGC Nice, a club whose colours I proudly defended for more than 10 years and the people in place, who are currently preparing for one of the most important meetings in their history in the European Cup (Europa Conference League). The timing of these revelations revolts me as much as their content.\\u201d\\n\\nINEOS did not wish to comment due to ongoing legal proceedings.\\n\\nValovic-Galtier reportedly denied the claims on his private Instagram account. \\u201cThank you all for your support,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cThe accusations against me are false and intolerable. They will not go unanswered.\\u201d\\n\\n##  **What is being investigated \\u2014 and who by?**\\n\\nOn Friday, the public prosecutor for Nice, Xavier Bonhomme, confirmed a preliminary investigation had been opened on the \\u201cgrounds of discrimination based on alleged race or belonging to religion\\u201d, and that \\u201ca police search was under way at the premises of OGC Nice\\u201d.\\n\\nDespite reports to the contrary, Paris Saint-Germain have not opened an internal investigation into the case. Internally, there is a feeling at PSG that the allegations were first denied months ago and that the new developments may have been brought up because of Galtier\\u2019s precarious position, in the wake of a poor run of form in the league. They have continued to support Galtier, noting the legal action he is taking.\\n\\nAs seen above, Nice, in their statement, refer to dealing with the situation with the \\u201cutmost seriousness\\u201d last summer.\\n\\nDidier Digard has been in charge of Nice since Lucien Favre was sacked in January (Photo: VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\n\\u201cI had said that two versions clashed and that the truth was going to come out,\\u201d said Nice caretaker manager Digard on Saturday. \\u201cI was not taking sides. I remained very straight in my statement. Now, it\\u2019s good for us that justice has been seized, we have the certainty that a truth will come out and at that time we may be able to express ourselves, but not until then. That there is a preliminary investigation? It\\u2019s great, sincerely, otherwise it\\u2019s the public tribunal, and it\\u2019s terrible.\\n\\n\\u201cThese cases \\u2014 the problem is they affect families, and when they affect families, it tires a little more than football. Me, it\\u2019s football that I like. If we have to talk about religion, I will never talk about it in public.\\u201d\\n\\n##  **What has the public reaction been?**\\n\\nThere has been a shocked reaction in France, and the developments have made headlines. But there has also been caution. It remains a case of one side\\u2019s word against another. One of Paris Saint-Germain\\u2019s leading supporters\\u2019 groups, the Collectif Ultras Paris, called for Galtier to leave the club if he is found guilty of making the alleged remarks.\\n\\nGaltier has received public support from several former players, coaches and colleagues, particularly from those who had worked with him at his previous clubs, including Lille, Saint-Etienne and Sochaux, the latter where he was assistant.\\n\\nThat includes public support from Jose Fonte, who worked under Galtier during his title-winning season at Lille in 2020-21, Mevlut Erding, the former PSG, Saint-Etienne and Sochaux player, former Sochaux player Fousseni Diawara, ex-Saint-Etienne sports director Damien Comolli and Saint-Etienne chairman Roland Romeyer, among others.\\n\\nBurak Yilmaz, who is a Muslim and played under Galtier at Lille in 2020-21, wrote on Instagram: \\u201cI read the news today and I felt I had to say something. I worked with Galtier and never felt negative behaviour on his part because of my religion or my nationality. He is a great coach as much as a great person.\\u201d\\n\\nIsmael Diomande, who worked with Galtier throughout his time as a coach at Saint-Etienne between, told L\\u2019Equipe he was surprised by the news, adding: \\u201cI am a Muslim and I never had any problems with him. And I was not the only Muslim in the group. Whoever wanted to do Ramadan could do it, whoever didn\\u2019t want to do it didn\\u2019t. On the racism side: frankly, I was surprised because I never had any problems with him. As a human, it\\u2019s someone good, I keep a positive image of the man.\\u201c\\n\\nBrest coach Eric Roy, who played with Galtier at Marseille in 1996-97 and worked with Fournier at Nice, spoke to the media in a press conference before his side\\u2019s match with Nice at the weekend. He said: \\u201cIf Galtier was racist, we would have known about it for a long time. You don\\u2019t spend 30 years in dressing rooms without having a label. Knowing the two characters, I will therefore put more doubt on the whistleblower than on Galtier.\\u201d\\n\\n##  **How have the players and staff responded at PSG and Nice?**\\n\\nGaltier claimed in his press conference that he had not spoken with his players about the subject. \\u201cBut they have given me the best response by the way they have been training so far,\\u201d he said. PSG beat Lens 3-1 to strengthen their hand in the Ligue 1 title race.\\n\\nA source close to the squad, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect their relationships, suggested, like many people, that they are waiting for clarity and what transpires from any new investigation.\\n\\nAt Nice, there has been limited discussion of the topic. Other than Digard\\u2019s remarks in press conferences, no one else has spoken out about the claims. The timing of these new developments for the club \\u2014 like for Galtier at a moment of his vulnerability amid pressure at PSG \\u2014 was not ideal. They emerged two days before the first leg of their Europa Conference League last-16 tie with FC Basel, arguably their biggest match of the season. They would draw in Basel, but lost to Brest on Sunday.\\n\\nSpeaking as a pundit for Amazon Prime on Sunday, Thierry Henry criticised the silence from Nice.\\n\\n\\u201cThere is someone who must speak, more than these three lines that we have seen recently (in a press release),\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere must be someone who must come and explain to us what happened. Yes, I know it happened with two people who are no longer at the club, but we are talking about your club, your institution anyway.\\n\\n\\u201cI need to hear what happened on the other side\\u201d.\\n\\n##  **What next for Galtier?**\\n\\nVictory over Lens offered another small on-field reprieve for Galtier. Defeat would have seen Lens reduce the gap to three points at the top of the table. But now, with an eight-point lead over new chasers Marseille and a favourable run-in ahead, PSG remain on course to win a record 11th league title.\\n\\nAfter the victory over Lens, Galtier publicly thanked club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Luis Campos for their support.\\n\\nBut his position long term is by no means safe, owing to matters on the field. PSG have long since had the intention of holding on to Galtier until the season has concluded. However, the expectation remains that Galtier, who has one year left on his contract, will likely depart in the summer having failed to deliver Champions League success.\\n\\nWhen Galtier took the job, he would have been well aware of the scrutiny that comes with being PSG manager. That is the nature of the task. But the way 2023 has unfolded for the coach, a job that was once a dream has descended into a nightmare. As Le Parisien surmised this week, it has been an \\u201cannus horribilis\\u201d for Galtier. And it is difficult to see the light.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you prepare to become coach of PSG, you know that were will be pressure, comments, analysis criticism,\\u201d he said on Friday. \\u201cBut this is something away from sport. I couldn\\u2019t expect that, but that is how it is, and that is what I\\u2019m living through.\\u201d\\n\\n _Additional reporting by Mario Cortegana_\\n\\n _(Top image: Photo: Getty Images; design Eamonn Dalton)_\\n\",\n",

            "                    \"mini_summary\": \"There is more than just a league title at stake in the top-of-the-table clash between Paris Saint-Germain and RC Lens. Prior to the fixture, PSG head coach Christophe Galtier was accused of using racist and insulting remarks about his own players when in charge of Nice last season. Galtier denied the accusations and stated that he would take legal action against those who are \\\"damaging my reputation\\\". A legal investigation has been launched, and Galtier is now at the mercy of the court of public opinion. This scandal, known as L\\u2019Affaire Galtier, has caused a stir in the media and threatens to cast a shadow over the 56-year-old unless he can clear his name.\\nTensions between Christophe Galtier, coach of French Ligue 1 outfit Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and Olympique Gymnaste Club Nice Cote D'Azur (OGC Nice) ultras were inflamed by ardent chanting ahead of their game on 8 April. Galtier had returned to Nice for the first time since leaving for PSG last summer, and during the match, he sarcastically applauded the Nice supporters, who had unfurled a banner, which Galtier said included insults against his mother. Allegations of tension prior to his departure from Nice have continued to surface, including disputes reportedly surrounding the recruitment of Muslim players and their decision to fast during Ramadan.\\n\\nAn email containing allegations of racism and discrimination against OGC Nice manager, Christophe Galtier, and his wife, has been reported by journalists. The email reportedly contains comments allegedly made by Galtier, including that he \\\"could not have so many blacks and Muslims in the team\\\". The email also alleges that Galtier said he did not want to sign a Muslim player, and that Galtier's wife, Martine Valovic-Galtier, made racist and insulting remarks. The email was reportedly sent to OGC Nice's general manager, Julien Fournier, who is said to have given the information to former club chairman Bob Ratcliffe.\\nParis Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier has denied any racist behavior and launched a complaint against those involved in making accusations of racial abuse against him. His phone number was leaked and he and his family have been given added personal protection. Galtier has denied the accusations publicly in a pre-prepared statement at the start of Friday\\u2019s pre-match press conference. Paris Saint-Germain called on everyone to remain calm while waiting for the conclusion of the judicial process. Nice made a statement noting that the situation had been treated seriously at the time of the events and would not provide further comment.\\nA preliminary investigation has been opened on the grounds of discrimination based on alleged race or belonging to religion at OGC Nice. There were reports that Paris Saint-Germain had opened an internal investigation, but internally, there is a feeling at PSG that the allegations were first denied months ago and that the new developments may have been brought up because of Galtier\\u2019s precarious position. Nice referred to dealing with the situation with the \\u201cutmost seriousness\\u201d last summer. Nice caretaker manager Digard said that it's great that justice has been seized so that a truth will come out.\\nThere has been a mixed reaction to the allegations of racism made against Paris Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier. Numerous former players, coaches and colleagues, particularly from those who worked with Galtier at previous clubs, including Lille, Saint-Etienne and Sochaux, have publicly supported him. Galtier has yet to make a statement on the allegations. Meanwhile, PSG's leading supporters' group, the Collectif Ultras Paris, has called for Galtier to leave the club if he is found guilty. It remains a case of one side's word against the other.\\nIn the wake of allegations of match-fixing in French football, PSG and Nice have mostly remained silent on the subject. Galtier denied speaking to his team about the claims and said their response had been to focus on training. A source close to the Nice squad said that the club is waiting for clarity before taking a stance publicly. Thierry Henry criticised Nice's lack of response to the claims, stating that someone should explain what happened. The timing of the development was also poor for both clubs - Nice faced the news ahead of an important Europa Conference League game, while PSG's coach Galtier was under pressure at the time.\\nAfter a victory over Lens, PSG still holds an eight-point lead at the top of the league table and remains on track to win their 11th league title. Although manager Christophe Galtier thanked the club's president and sporting director for their support after the win, his position is not secure due to the team's lack of success in the Champions League. Galtier's job has become challenging, and it is unlikely that he will remain with PSG beyond this season. Despite being aware of the scrutiny he would face as PSG manager, it has been a \\\"terrible year\\\" for Galtier.\"\n",

            "                    \"mini_summary\": \"Picture this. You are fighting relegation and 5-1 down at home for the second game in a row. Your fans are slowly filtering out of the stadium, the hope of a result already long out of sight. Then you look across to the dugouts and see your opponents are about to bring on Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Roberto Firmino.\\n\\nIf Leeds United were cursing their misfortune on Monday night, then Jurgen Klopp must also have been wondering what might have been had he been able to call on such an awesome array of attacking talent all season (he also threw on Thiago three minutes later, just for good measure.)\\n\\nIt is certainly hard to imagine Liverpool languishing in eighth place, nine points off Newcastle United in fourth, had these players \\u2013 together with Mo Salah, Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo, who all started at Elland Road \\u2013 been available for most of this campaign. Chances are, Liverpool would have been in the thick of the title race, just like most predicted they would be.\\n\\nDarwin Nunez came on to score against Leeds and underline the depth of Liverpool\\u2019s attacking resources (Photo: Naomi Baker/Getty Images)\\n\\nInjuries happen to all teams, of course, and they alone are not an excuse for some seriously poor performances this season. But Liverpool\\u2019s absences have cut particularly deep in attacking areas: Diaz, the spark of the run-in a year ago, has played just nine league games due to injury; Jota, meanwhile, missed four months. It all contributed to a harsh winter for Liverpool which saw them plunge out of contention for major honours, with Klopp unable to rest and rotate as he would have liked.\\n\\nNow, things are far brighter. In fact, there is a chance that this patchy, frustrating season actually ends with Liverpool qualifying for the Champions League.\\n\\nSounds implausible, right? Well, do not take my word for it: predictor gods FiveThirtyEight have calculated that Liverpool have a 22 per cent chance of qualifying for the Champions League.\\n\\nIf that sounds generous, consider the facts. In the past five seasons, 71 points has been enough to qualify for Europe\\u2019s premier competition. How many points can Liverpool finish the season with? 71.\\n\\nTo do that they have to win all of their remaining eight games \\u2013 a tough ask, but hardly unprecedented. In 2020-21, Liverpool themselves pieced together a late charge to win eight of their 10 remaining matches to finish third. And that was a team that had lost six successive games at Anfield earlier that season.\\n\\nThe chances of embarking on a similar run now may be slim but they are not negligible. Klopp, after all, has all his \\u201cSuper Six\\u201d (Nunez, Diaz, Firmino, Jota, Gakpo and Salah) available for the first time this season, and does any team in the Premier League or Europe have that many high-quality avengers to assemble in attack? That is some serious depth.\\n\\nThey also have a kinder-looking run-in than the teams around them. Looking at FiveThirtyEight\\u2019s Soccer Power Index (SPI) ratings, Liverpool have no games rated \\u201chard\\u201d.\\n\\nOf course, this is on paper, and no Liverpool fan \\u2013 or, indeed, Klopp \\u2013 needs to be reminded how many bottom-half teams (including this weekend\\u2019s opponents Nottingham Forest) have taken points from their side this season. Leeds was the first time Liverpool had even scored a goal in a game away at a bottom-half club this season.\\n\\nEven so, the supercomputer says Liverpool have three \\u201ceasy\\u201d games against Forest, Fulham and Southampton, as well as five games rated\\u201dmedium\\u201d against West Ham, Tottenham, Brentford, Leicester and Aston Villa.\\n\\nOut of their eight opponents, Liverpool will only play two who are currently ranked above them.\\n\\nIf there was ever a time to feel positive as a Liverpool fan this season it is now.\\n\\nAnother boost to Liverpool (who have won just 16 points out of a possible 48 away from home) is they only have three games left on the road. The other six are at Anfield where Liverpool have only lost once (to Leeds) in the past 37 league fixtures \\u2013 winning 27 and drawing nine. The last time they failed to score at home in the past 37 games was against Chelsea in January.\\n\\nThe challenge for Klopp\\u2019s team is to ensure that the hammering of Leeds was not a glorious one-off. Recent history does not inspire confidence: after beating Bournemouth 9-0 in August, they won only one of their next three games, while in the two games after thrashing Manchester United 7-0, they slumped to successive 1-0 defeats against Bournemouth and Real Madrid.\\nLiverpool have a chance to qualify for the Champions League, with a 22% chance predicted by FiveThirtyEight. The turnaround follows a season of injuries to key attacking players, however, they now have a depth of talent that is not rivalled in the Premier League. Liverpool's upcoming fixtures are rated between \\\"easy\\\" and \\\"medium\\\" in difficulty, with six games on home soil, where they have a track record of success. Liverpool will need to ensure it uses its strong line up to continue their current winning streak to qualify.\\nThose occasional highs add to the sense of this being a season of curious extremes at Anfield \\u2013 one where 39 per cent of the club\\u2019s 56 league goals have been scored in just three games (Bournemouth, Manchester United and Leeds). To put that into context, the only other teams to have scored 35 per cent or more of their whole Premier League season\\u2019s goals tally in three games were relegation battlers: Everton in 1998-99, Birmingham in 2005-06, Huddersfield in 2017-18 and Watford in 2021-22.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s more. Those three games have provided Liverpool with 22 goals at an expected goals (xG) tally of just 8.8. In the other 27 games they have scored 34 goals from a combined xG of 46.7 \\u2013 meaning they have underperformed by 12.7 xG. These goals need to be more evenly spread over the run-in.\\n\\nLiverpool have been joyful and woeful this season, just not in equal measure. Now, though, there is a chance for Klopp\\u2019s players to have some fun, to let their attack freewheel and to end the season on a high ahead of a crucial summer rebuild.\\n\\nLeeds might be another false dawn in a season many would be glad to see the back of. But maybe, just maybe, it\\u2019s not.\\n\\n _(Top photo: Tim Goode/PA Images via Getty Images)_\\nLiverpool has experienced a season of extreme highs and lows, with 39% of their Premier League goals coming from three games against Bournemouth, Manchester United, and Leeds. This statistic is significant as the only other teams to score 35% or more of their Premier League goals in three games are typically relegation battlers. Liverpool has also underperformed in terms of expected goals, with their 22 goals from 8.8 expected goals in those three games highlighting the need for more evenly spread scoring over their remaining games. Despite this, they have the opportunity to finish the season on a high and rebuild for the summer.\"\n",

Within a few months, the manager who had taken us so close to the Championship, Russell Slade, had been sacked and a few months and three managers later, Orient were relegated to League Two. Two years later, for the first time in their history, the O\\u2019s dropped out of the Football League at the end of a campaign in which five different managers had briefly occupied the dugout. The axe fell after a 3-0 defeat to Crewe, with a team largely made of Academy players on the pitch, including a 16-year-old Jayden Sweeney who has been an integral member of the team promoted back to League One this season. A rose who grew out of the mud.</p><p>I will choose my words carefully, but Becchetti was a foolish and vain character who stopped bankrolling the club after making it live beyond its means with a ridiculously high turnover of staff and overpaid, ageing players, spitefully not attending matches once fans became critical.</p><p>The club had been torn apart and he seemed willing to let it rot, his ego and pride unable to deal with the fact the fans had turned against him. \\u00a0The club was loaded with debt and the vultures circled.</p><h2 class=\\\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\\\">Orient had become a basket case \\u2013 and a non-league club</h2><p>Orient were very nearly another Bury, Hereford United, Darlington, Kidderminster Harriers, Rushden and Diamonds or Aldershot. Within four years, the O\\u2019s had gone from the brink of promotion to the Championship to basket case and non-league club for the first time.</p><p>It was in 2017, as Orient dropped out of the league, that I was told I had skin cancer. Hearing the diagnosis left me numb. For the first time, I was faced with my own sense of mortality. That death was real and stalking me. I don\\u2019t \\u00a0remember much about that Orient season. It was so bad, I have largely erased it from my memory to save me from unnecessary anger and pain.</p><p>Thankfully, we caught the cancer early. It was removed. The only reminder, a deep scar on my back where my skin and flesh was scooped out like a spoon into ice cream. I healed. So did Orient.</p><p>Salvation came later that summer, with the arrival of Nigel Travis, the CEO of Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts, and a boyhood fan who was introduced to co-owner and vice-president Kent Teague through mutual friends. After weeks of tense, secretive negotiations, they finally agreed a deal with Bechetti and the worst owner in the club\\u2019s history was finally gone.\\u00a0</p><h2 class=\\\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\\\">From the joy of promotion, further tragedy strikes</h2><p>They appointed Martin Ling, the former Tottenham, Swindon Town and Orient player and manager (who won the club\\u2019s last promotion to League One back in 2007) as director of football. And eventually Justin Edinburgh as manager. Promotion from the National League, confirmed on a joyous day in the April sunshine, with a 0-0 draw against Braintree Town and a wild on the pitch celebration, followed before tragedy struck.</p><p>A few weeks after celebrating promotion in May 2019, Edinburgh suffered a fatal heart attack while running on a treadmill. He was just 49-years-old.</p><p>It was a terrible strike of fate, which I did not know at the time, would also resonate with me. Running up the stairs in January 2021, I had a sudden, severe pain in my chest which spread down my arms. When I was operated on eight months later, surgeons discovered my main artery was 95 per cent blocked. If heart disease had not run in my family \\u2013 if I had not seen <a href=\\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2019/06/09/justin-edinburgh-leyton-orient-manager-former-defender-1991/\\\">what had happened to Orient\\u2019s former manager</a> \\u2013 I may not have got checked out. I may well be dead now.</p><p>Less than two years later, my uncle Simon, who had accompanied my mum, dad and brother to so many games through the years, lost his battle with cancer. Like so many others in lockdown, he died isolated and apart from family. He could not even spend his final days watching his beloved Orient because football was played behind closed doors. I could not even go to his funeral because of the restrictions on indoor gatherings. The last season he was able to travel to games regularly came in that promotion year in the National League. At least he saw the club climb out of a league which it should never have fallen into.</p><p>I thought of him, hunched over my laptop in the dining room on Tuesday night, watching Orient lose at Gillingham. Even in his 70s, Simon would have been on the pitch celebrating wildly, doing his little \\u201cvictory jig\\u201d, hopping from one foot to the other, with a single finger pointing to the sky, that used to accompany every Orient goal.</p><p>Those two deaths left a deep scar, but the rebirth Edinburgh started did not end when he died. After a tough 18 months back in League Two, the appointment of Richie Wellens in February last year <a href=\\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/11/07/richie-wellens-manchester-united-salford-leyton-orient-ferguson/\\\">altered the course of history</a> once more.</p>\\n  \\n</div><meta itemprop=\\\"url\\\" content=\\\"/content/dam/football/2023/04/19/TELEMMGLPICT000314063677_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX6NvVzIgGgHgtCsfF0e-9Xqwc2rXjgkzPQN_Jup5I0w.jpeg\\\"><meta itemprop=\\\"width\\\" content=\\\"2213\\\"><meta itemprop=\\\"height\\\" content=\\\"1383\\\"><div class=\\\"component article-body-text\\\" data-test=\\\"article-body-text\\\"><p>[image]Richie Wellens - My journey with Leyton Orient through tragedy, recovery and \\u2013 finally \\u2013 promotion</p><img alt=\\\"Richie Wellens - My journey with Leyton Orient through tragedy, recovery and \\u2013 finally \\u2013 promotion\\\" src=\\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2023/04/19/TELEMMGLPICT000314063677_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX6NvVzIgGgHgtCsfF0e-9Xqwc2rXjgkzPQN_Jup5I0w.jpeg?imwidth=480\\\"></div><figcaption class=\\\"e-caption u-meta e-caption--has-separator   \\\" data-js=\\\"caption\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t<span itemprop=\\\"caption\\\" data-test=\\\"caption\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe future is looking brighter under manager Richie Wellens\\n\\t\\t\\t</span>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"e-caption__credit\\\" itemprop=\\\"copyrightHolder\\\" data-test=\\\"credit\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"e-caption__credit-description\\\">Credit</span>: Telegraph Sport/Paul Grover\\n\\t\\t\\t</span>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t</figcaption><div class=\\\"component article-body-text   \\\" data-test=\\\"article-body-text\\\">\\n  \\n  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    <p>The \\u201cchippy Manc\\u201d, sacked by Doncaster Rovers and Salford before landing in E10, kept Orient up comfortably. This year he has led the team to arguably its best season in living memory.</p><p>This has been, without question or doubt, one of the most enjoyable campaigns of my lifetime, with just six defeats in a league the O\\u2019s have led since early autumn. It is unparalleled success. This is, to put it bluntly, not what supporting Orient is normally like. We are used to failure, conditioned to underachieve, almost revelling in the club\\u2019s persistent inability to get things right.</p><p>Even during the good times, something always seemed to go wrong and a decline would set in. Even during the years of relative success, disappointment was lurking around the corner. Even promotion itself was secured with a defeat. You get used to it.</p><p>Suffering and smiling through the pain is what being an Orient supporter is or, at least, was. It breeds a special kind of fan, one used to being hurt; used to being let down; used to being laughed at \\u2013 but being able to laugh at themselves while it happens. It breeds a family-type bond. The hardcore fans, the 3,000-4,000 who have always been there regardless of form, results or league position and the occasional droppers in, like distant cousins at a wedding. It is because of this, that Orient, as Wellens said earlier this month, is a club with soul.</p><p>Little old Leyton Orient, tucked away in a previously unfashionable corner of east London, its fan base straddling the border between Greater London and Essex. Patted on the head, patronised and largely ignored by all others than those who fell in love with this idiosyncratic \\u00a0team.</p><p>It is that history, that reputation, that has made this campaign so extraordinary. Orient have been promoted before (four times in my four decades, with five relegations) but this time they are set to go up as league champions. The best in the league is not a sentence Orient fans have read or heard before, other than during those bleak, dark years in the National League when the very future of the club hung in the balance.</p><p>Players like goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux \\u2013 who has set a new club record for clean sheets already this season \\u2013 centre-back (and PFA chairman) Omar Beckles, captain Darren Pratley, the little wizard Paul Smyth, the flying Scotsman Theo Archibald and the magnificent midfielder Idris El Mizouni (on loan from Ipswich Town) as good any any seen through the decades of mediocrity at Brisbane Road.</p><h2 class=\\\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\\\">League One awaits: Orient finally living the dream</h2><p>You probably have not heard of them, but in E10, these guys are heroes who will become legends. They deserve their moment in the spotlight, before returning to the shade of the lower leagues. They have made a long-suffering fanbase abnormally happy.</p><p>The club that gave England captain Harry Kane his professional debut \\u2013 Kane very generously sponsors the club through donations to charities which are emblazoned on the front of matchday shirts \\u2013 have not only been promoted, they have dominated a division like never before.</p><p>I have not seen an Orient team be so ruthlessly efficient while playing a style of football that has made even the most battle-hardened and weary supporters purr with delight.</p><p>A football club defined by its decades of underachievement has changed at last. With conscientious and ambitious owners, an astute director of football and a very talented manager with something to prove. A manager who gets what this club was about and what he needs to change.</p><p>We are living a dream. For once, just maybe, even better is to come. From the loss of my daughter to the birth of my son. From childhood, through the teenage years, and young adult life and into middle age and the health scares it has brought. Leyton Orient have always been there, they are my roots and as much a part of my life now as they ever were. And they will still be there long after I am gone. Up the O\\u2019s.</p>\\n  \\n</div></div></div></body></html>\",\n",

Within four years, the O\\u2019s had gone from the brink of promotion to the Championship to basket case and non-league club for the first time.\\n\\nIt was in 2017, as Orient dropped out of the league, that I was told I had skin cancer. Hearing the diagnosis left me numb. For the first time, I was faced with my own sense of mortality. That death was real and stalking me. I don\\u2019t remember much about that Orient season. It was so bad, I have largely erased it from my memory to save me from unnecessary anger and pain.\\n\\nThankfully, we caught the cancer early. It was removed. The only reminder, a deep scar on my back where my skin and flesh was scooped out like a spoon into ice cream. I healed. So did Orient.\\n\\nSalvation came later that summer, with the arrival of Nigel Travis, the CEO of Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts, and a boyhood fan who was introduced to co-owner and vice-president Kent Teague through mutual friends. After weeks of tense, secretive negotiations, they finally agreed a deal with Bechetti and the worst owner in the club\\u2019s history was finally gone. \\n\\n## From the joy of promotion, further tragedy strikes\\n\\nThey appointed Martin Ling, the former Tottenham, Swindon Town and Orient player and manager (who won the club\\u2019s last promotion to League One back in 2007) as director of football. And eventually Justin Edinburgh as manager. Promotion from the National League, confirmed on a joyous day in the April sunshine, with a 0-0 draw against Braintree Town and a wild on the pitch celebration, followed before tragedy struck.\\n\\nA few weeks after celebrating promotion in May 2019, Edinburgh suffered a fatal heart attack while running on a treadmill. He was just 49-years-old.\\n\\nIt was a terrible strike of fate, which I did not know at the time, would also resonate with me. Running up the stairs in January 2021, I had a sudden, severe pain in my chest which spread down my arms. When I was operated on eight months later, surgeons discovered my main artery was 95 per cent blocked. If heart disease had not run in my family \\u2013 if I had not seen what had happened to Orient\\u2019s former manager \\u2013 I may not have got checked out. I may well be dead now.\\n\\nLess than two years later, my uncle Simon, who had accompanied my mum, dad and brother to so many games through the years, lost his battle with cancer. Like so many others in lockdown, he died isolated and apart from family. He could not even spend his final days watching his beloved Orient because football was played behind closed doors. I could not even go to his funeral because of the restrictions on indoor gatherings. The last season he was able to travel to games regularly came in that promotion year in the National League. At least he saw the club climb out of a league which it should never have fallen into.\\n\\nI thought of him, hunched over my laptop in the dining room on Tuesday night, watching Orient lose at Gillingham. Even in his 70s, Simon would have been on the pitch celebrating wildly, doing his little \\u201cvictory jig\\u201d, hopping from one foot to the other, with a single finger pointing to the sky, that used to accompany every Orient goal.\\n\\nThose two deaths left a deep scar, but the rebirth Edinburgh started did not end when he died. After a tough 18 months back in League Two, the appointment of Richie Wellens in February last year altered the course of history once more.\\n\\n[image]Richie Wellens - My journey with Leyton Orient through tragedy, recovery and \\u2013 finally \\u2013 promotion\\n\\nThe future is looking brighter under manager Richie Wellens  Credit: Telegraph Sport/Paul Grover \\n\\nThe \\u201cchippy Manc\\u201d, sacked by Doncaster Rovers and Salford before landing in E10, kept Orient up comfortably. This year he has led the team to arguably its best season in living memory.\\n\\nThis has been, without question or doubt, one of the most enjoyable campaigns of my lifetime, with just six defeats in a league the O\\u2019s have led since early autumn. It is unparalleled success. This is, to put it bluntly, not what supporting Orient is normally like. We are used to failure, conditioned to underachieve, almost revelling in the club\\u2019s persistent inability to get things right.\\n\\nEven during the good times, something always seemed to go wrong and a decline would set in. Even during the years of relative success, disappointment was lurking around the corner. Even promotion itself was secured with a defeat. You get used to it.\\n\\nSuffering and smiling through the pain is what being an Orient supporter is or, at least, was. It breeds a special kind of fan, one used to being hurt; used to being let down; used to being laughed at \\u2013 but being able to laugh at themselves while it happens. It breeds a family-type bond. The hardcore fans, the 3,000-4,000 who have always been there regardless of form, results or league position and the occasional droppers in, like distant cousins at a wedding. It is because of this, that Orient, as Wellens said earlier this month, is a club with soul.\\n\\nLittle old Leyton Orient, tucked away in a previously unfashionable corner of east London, its fan base straddling the border between Greater London and Essex. Patted on the head, patronised and largely ignored by all others than those who fell in love with this idiosyncratic team.\\n\\nIt is that history, that reputation, that has made this campaign so extraordinary. Orient have been promoted before (four times in my four decades, with five relegations) but this time they are set to go up as league champions. The best in the league is not a sentence Orient fans have read or heard before, other than during those bleak, dark years in the National League when the very future of the club hung in the balance.\\n\\nPlayers like goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux \\u2013 who has set a new club record for clean sheets already this season \\u2013 centre-back (and PFA chairman) Omar Beckles, captain Darren Pratley, the little wizard Paul Smyth, the flying Scotsman Theo Archibald and the magnificent midfielder Idris El Mizouni (on loan from Ipswich Town) as good any any seen through the decades of mediocrity at Brisbane Road.\\n\\n## League One awaits: Orient finally living the dream\\n\\nYou probably have not heard of them, but in E10, these guys are heroes who will become legends. They deserve their moment in the spotlight, before returning to the shade of the lower leagues. They have made a long-suffering fanbase abnormally happy.\\n\\nThe club that gave England captain Harry Kane his professional debut \\u2013 Kane very generously sponsors the club through donations to charities which are emblazoned on the front of matchday shirts \\u2013 have not only been promoted, they have dominated a division like never before.\\n\\nI have not seen an Orient team be so ruthlessly efficient while playing a style of football that has made even the most battle-hardened and weary supporters purr with delight.\\n\\nA football club defined by its decades of underachievement has changed at last. With conscientious and ambitious owners, an astute director of football and a very talented manager with something to prove. A manager who gets what this club was about and what he needs to change.\\n\\nWe are living a dream. For once, just maybe, even better is to come. From the loss of my daughter to the birth of my son. From childhood, through the teenage years, and young adult life and into middle age and the health scares it has brought. Leyton Orient have always been there, they are my roots and as much a part of my life now as they ever were. And they will still be there long after I am gone. Up the O\\u2019s.\\n\",\n",

            "                    \"mini_summary\": \"The article is a personal story about a football fan's journey with Leyton Orient through tragedy, recovery, and promotion. It starts with the death of the fan's baby daughter in 2013, which led to depression. The fan found escape in following Leyton Orient's stunning campaign, which featured a special team of talented players. The team was chasing promotion to the second tier of English football, and although they fell short that season, the fan continued to support the team through the good times and bad. This week, despite losing their final game of the season, Leyton Orient was promoted to League One.\\nLeyton Orient's fall from grace began after their play-off final defeat against Rotherham United in 2014, and worsened after chairman Barry Hearn sold the club to a mysterious Italian businessman, Francesco Becchetti, who failed to fulfil promises of funding. The club went through a series of managers as well as a high turnover of staff and overpaid, ageing players, leading to a huge debt. Becchetti refused to attend matches once fans criticised him and the club's fate seemed doomed until a team largely made up of academy players, including a 16-year-old, won promotion back to League One this season.\\nOrient were very nearly another Bury, Hereford United, Darlington, Kidderminster Harriers, Rushden and Diamonds or Aldershot. Within four years, the O\\u2019s had gone from the brink of promotion to the Championship to basket case and non-league club for the first time.\\n\\nIt was in 2017, as Orient dropped out of the league, that I was told I had skin cancer. Hearing the diagnosis left me numb. For the first time, I was faced with my own sense of mortality. That death was real and stalking me. I don\\u2019t remember much about that Orient season. It was so bad, I have largely erased it from my memory to save me from unnecessary anger and pain.\\n\\nThankfully, we caught the cancer early. It was removed. The only reminder, a deep scar on my back where my skin and flesh was scooped out like a spoon into ice cream. I healed. So did Orient.\\n\\nSalvation came later that summer, with the arrival of Nigel Travis, the CEO of Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts, and a boyhood fan who was introduced to co-owner and vice-president Kent Teague through mutual friends. After weeks of tense, secretive negotiations, they finally agreed a deal with Bechetti and the worst owner in the club\\u2019s history was finally gone.\\nLeyton Orient was on the brink of becoming a struggling football club and even went on to become a non-league club after almost getting promoted to the Championship four years ago. The writer of the article was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2017 during an abysmal season for the club. However, the cancer was caught early and removed. The CEO of Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts, Nigel Travis, and a boyhood fan, along with the vice-president Kent Teague, agreed to take over the club and finally replaced the detrimental owner in the summer.\\nLeyton Orient, a football club that has been known for its perpetual underachievement, is experiencing an unprecedented level of success with just six defeats in a league they have led since autumn. The success is a culmination of years of hard work, including appointing veteran director of football Martin Ling and later Justin Edinburgh as the manager. After Edinburgh's sudden death in 2019 from a heart attack, the club was left reeling but managed to regroup under Richie Wellens, who kept the team in League Two last season and has led them to arguably their best season in living memory this year. This success is particularly poignant for supporters who have endured years of disappointment and underachievement, creating a special kind of bond between fans who have stuck with the club through thick and thin.\\nPlayers like goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux \\u2013 who has set a new club record for clean sheets already this season \\u2013 centre-back (and PFA chairman) Omar Beckles, captain Darren Pratley, the little wizard Paul Smyth, the flying Scotsman Theo Archibald and the magnificent midfielder Idris El Mizouni (on loan from Ipswich Town) as good any any seen through the decades of mediocrity at Brisbane Road.\\nSome of the players in the current Leyton Orient football team, including goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux, defender Omar Beckles, captain Darren Pratley, forward Paul Smyth, winger Theo Archibald, and midfielder Idris El Mizouni (on loan from Ipswich Town) are considered as some of the best players the club has seen, despite the team's history of being average. Vigouroux has already set a new club record for clean sheets this season.\\nYou probably have not heard of them, but in E10, these guys are heroes who will become legends. They deserve their moment in the spotlight, before returning to the shade of the lower leagues. They have made a long-suffering fanbase abnormally happy.\\n\\nThe club that gave England captain Harry Kane his professional debut \\u2013 Kane very generously sponsors the club through donations to charities which are emblazoned on the front of matchday shirts \\u2013 have not only been promoted, they have dominated a division like never before.\\n\\nI have not seen an Orient team be so ruthlessly efficient while playing a style of football that has made even the most battle-hardened and weary supporters purr with delight.\\n\\nA football club defined by its decades of underachievement has changed at last. With conscientious and ambitious owners, an astute director of football and a very talented manager with something to prove. A manager who gets what this club was about and what he needs to change.\\n\\nWe are living a dream. For once, just maybe, even better is to come. From the loss of my daughter to the birth of my son. From childhood, through the teenage years, and young adult life and into middle age and the health scares it has brought. Leyton Orient have always been there, they are my roots and as much a part of my life now as they ever were. And they will still be there long after I am gone. Up the O\\u2019s.\\nLeyton Orient, a football club based in E10, have become heroes and legends in their community after being promoted and dominating their division. The club has historically faced underachievement and disappointment, but with new and ambitious ownership, a talented manager, and a playing style that has delighted fans, they are transforming. The writer reflects on the importance of the club in their life and is hopeful for their continued success.\"\n",

            "                    \"mini_summary\": \"The functional end of Chelsea\\u2019s season last night against Real Madrid was also the death of a delusion.\\n\\nFor several months, a belief had been maintained amid the club\\u2019s ownership, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that this group of players were capable of salvaging a disastrous 2022-23 campaign by winning the Champions League \\u2014 a belief reflected in Todd Boehly\\u2019s bullish public \\u201c3-0\\u201d prediction ahead of the first leg of this quarter-final with holders Madrid, and one that had informed many of the more notable recent decisions taken at Stamford Bridge and the club\\u2019s Cobham training base.\\n\\nIt factored into the move to bring in Joao Felix from Atletico Madrid on a lavishly-expensive loan deal in mid-January, when Chelsea were already 10 points adrift of fourth place in the Premier League. Joao Felix was added to the Champions League squad at the expense of permanent January signings Benoit Badiashile and Noni Madueke, who have since been afforded fewer domestic minutes than they otherwise would have due to not being part of the European campaign.\\n\\nHead coach Graham Potter was primarily sacked due to a bigger loss of faith in his ability to preside over Boehly and co-owner Behdad Eghbali\\u2019s long-term project, but the timing of the club\\u2019s second coaching change of the season also betrayed a desperate hope that re-introducing club legend Frank Lampard might provide a jolt of positive energy in time to face Real Madrid.\\n\\nThat rationale had been shattered long before the European champions arrived at Stamford Bridge holding a 2-0 aggregate lead, with results flatlining as Lampard scrambled around in search of a structure and selection that reflects the level of talent at his disposal; this second leg saw his fourth different starting formation in the four matches he\\u2019s overseen, with an unorthodox XI that reflected his desire for \\u201cbig energy\\u201d in Chelsea\\u2019s last roll of the Champions League dice.\\n\\nHis selected team did succeed in making Madrid uncomfortable, with Conor Gallagher and N\\u2019Golo Kante driving a fierce high press either side of Kai Havertz that galvanised the crowd and Reece James pushing forward to overload the visitors\\u2019 makeshift left-back Eduardo Camavinga. It was logical within the context of one of Chelsea\\u2019s more illogical struggles this season: if you are no good at shooting the ball into the net, why not try pressing or tackling it in?\\n\\nKante and Marc Cucurella spurned Chelsea\\u2019s only clear chances with finishes in keeping with their career scoring records.\\n\\nMadrid never panicked, because their belief in their ability to work out any opponent in any situation is unshakeable and because, in truth, this was nothing even approaching real adversity for a team of their class.\\n\\nAt half-time, Carlo Ancelotti countered the problematic positioning of Kante by shifting Federico Valverde from right to left, neutralising Chelsea\\u2019s biggest area of superiority and making it more complicated for Cucurella to decide who to press on the opposite side. When he charged upfield, leaving Trevoh Chalobah with an ocean of space to defend behind him, Eder Militao promptly sprang Rodrygo for what became the opening goal of the night.\\n\\nLampard\\u2019s \\u00a3120million triple substitution with just over 20 minutes to go \\u2014 introducing Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk and Joao Felix \\u2014 was the signal for Madrid to cut open their now more ambitious hosts with a transition sequence executed with lightning precision by Vinicius Junior and Valverde, and converted at walking pace by Rodrygo.\\n\\nThere could be no clearer evidence to the watching Boehly that a mess of elite talent can never hope to compete against a team of great players with a collective identity.\\n\\nJoao Felix, Mykhailo Mudryk and Raheem Sterling prepare to come on against Real Madrid (Photo: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)\\n\\nA significant number of supporters began streaming out of the ground once Rodrygo scored his second goal in the 80th minute. Many more will wish they could fast-forward the remaining seven matches of a season that, with all of the Premier League\\u2019s current top four still to play, could see Chelsea sink further into the bottom half of the table than their present position of 11th.\\n\\nBut being forced to abandon any wild dreams of Champions League-winning salvation could also present an opportunity to give these final weeks fresh value.\\n\\nThere is no more reason for Lampard, or anyone above him, to indulge in short-term thinking; the seven Chelsea teams we see from now through that finale at home to Newcastle on May 28 need to more accurately reflect which players in this bloated squad have a future at the club beyond this summer, and which do not.\\nChelsea's belief that they could salvage a disastrous campaign by winning the Champions League has been shattered. The club maintained this delusion despite mounting evidence to the contrary, leading to the mid-January loan deal for Joao Felix from Atletico Madrid. The move added Joao Felix to the Champions League squad at the expense of two permanent January signings, who have since been given fewer minutes due to not being part of the European campaign. Head coach Graham Potter was primarily sacked due to a loss of faith, but the timing of the club's second coaching change was also an attempt at positive energy. However, results continued to flatline with Lampard trying to find a structure and selection that reflected the level of talent at his disposal. Ultimately, the club must now focus on accurately assessing which players have a future at the club beyond this summer.\\nBadiashile has started only six of Chelsea\\u2019s 11 Premier League matches since the end of January. Just half of Mudryk\\u2019s 10 appearances in the Premier League have been starts, and he has only completed the equivalent of five full domestic games since signing. The most recent of Madueke\\u2019s two starts came against Southampton on February 18 \\u2014 which was also the last time David Datro Fofana kicked a ball for the first team \\u2014 and is yet to make one of Lampard\\u2019s Premier League matchday squads.\\n\\nThen there are the talented teenagers on the first-team fringes down at Cobham.\\n\\nCarney Chukwuemeka has been given a grand total of 36 senior minutes since starting against Crystal Palace on January 15. Lewis Hall, who enters the final two years of his contract this summer, has not played at all since starting against Liverpool at Anfield six days later. Omari Hutchinson probably deserves a better chance than 23 minutes off the bench when chasing an equaliser at home to Manchester City on the first Thursday of 2023, then getting the final half an hour at the same venue the following weekend when already 3-0 down in the FA Cup.\\n\\nIt would be easy to dismiss youth development as unfeasible in the midst of a 31-man senior squad, but Chelsea already know they will be looking to sell a significant number of that group in the summer \\u2014 and several of them, including Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic, are every bit as motivated to leave as the club are to get rid. The notion that any of the players on the chopping block will somehow increase their transfer value on the pitch in the final weeks of this season has surely been dispelled by all the available recent evidence.\\n\\nAs an interim placeholder, Lampard does not have the authority to make such seismic personnel decisions on behalf of the next permanent head coach, but co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart should be able to advise with fuller knowledge of the club\\u2019s future direction. If it is clear that permanent deals for Joao Felix and fellow loanee Denis Zakaria will not be pursued, for example, it is self-evident that they have no roles to play in these remaining matches.\\n\\nFrank Lampard cannot plan for the future at Chelsea but he could focus on players who are likely to still be involved in 2023-24 (Photo by Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)\\n\\nIn an ideal world, Potter\\u2019s successor would be confirmed sooner rather than later, in time to participate in the squad planning conversations that must take place in the coming weeks \\u2014 particularly regarding the more complicated contract situations of Kante and Mason Mount. Yet even if this does not end up being the case, there is no reason why Chelsea cannot begin to whittle down their core first-team group along the clearer lines that exist.\\n\\nTaking the longer view is a path the previous Roman Abramovich-led hierarchy spurned after dismissing Jose Mourinho in 2015-16, rendering Guus Hiddink\\u2019s second caretaker stint a dull kind of palate-cleansing purgatory. But that was a very different squad, far more proven and less removed from domestic contention than this current one.\\n\\nShorn of their last delusions of grandeur by Madrid last night, Chelsea could do with giving their supporters a few isolated glimmers of hope for the future in these next six weeks \\u2014 even if the bigger roadmap back to success cannot be drawn just yet.\\n\\n _(Top photo: Mateo Villalba/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)_\\nSeveral young players at Chelsea's disposal have made limited appearances in the team since the end of January. Lampard's inability to make long-term personnel decisions won't be an obstacle for the club's co-sporting directors who will advise on the future direction of the club. With an imminent squad overhaul in the summer, focusing on players likely to still be involved could be a wiser strategy. Consequently, giving younger players more game time would not only provide them with more experience but also give supporters a sense of hope for the future.\"\n",
