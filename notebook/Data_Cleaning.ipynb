But what comes next for a club needing a new leader and a player needing a new challenge?\\\\n\\\\nWe asked our **_Mirror Football_** team what they think.\\\\n\\\\n### Mike Walters\\\\n\\\\nIt's one of English football's greatest anomalies - how can Harry Maguire perform so well for England, and yet with such mediocrity for Manchester United?\\\\n\\\\nTo be captain of a major international institution like United, you need to be in the team every week, so Maguire can have few complaints about being stripped of the armband.\\\\n\\\\nNo great captains of industry earn their stripes in the waiting room when leadership is forged on the shop floor.\\\\n\\\\n![Maguire is out of favour at United](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30486270.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Man-United-Maguire-Soccer-23197592955745.jpg) Maguire is out of favour at United ( \\\\n\\\\nImage: \\\\n\\\\nAP)\\\\n\\\\nIf I were in Maguire's boots, I would clear off to a club where he would be more valued - but he will need to take a pay cut because few clubs interested in signing him, if any, can match his \\u00a3190,000-a-week wages.\\\\n\\\\nI always liked Maguire as a player, but there are too many accidents happening around him - even if they aren't his fault, like the double own-goal calamity against Sevilla last season. He has become the Frank Spencer of United's defence.\\\\n\\\\nA new start would make sense for all concerned... somewhere like West Ham or Wolves?\\\\n\\\\nAs for his replacement as United's appointed captain, don't give it to Bruno Fernandes. Great player, but he went missing like Shergar when the chips were down in the seven-goal humiliation at Anfield. Personally, I wouldn't follow him into the chip shop, let alone the trenches.\\\\n\\\\nAnyone for Luke Shaw?\\\", \\\"### Tom Blow\\\\n\\\\nHarry Maguire's situation at Manchester United is unique, so it's hard to judge Erik ten Hag's decision.\\\\n\\\\nThe England international has fallen behind Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw in the pecking order... and you can't be the captain if you're not playing.\\\\n\\\\nA skipper is usually shown the door when their time is up, but it's hard for United to do that because Maguire still has two years left on his contract. \\\\n\\\\nHe's believed to be earning \\u00a3190,000-a-week, a salary few clubs in the Premier League can match. United will probably need to pay some of his salary up front if they want him to leave Old Trafford this summer.\\\\n\\\\nFor all the talk of a transfer, there's every chance Maguire will stay at United as a squad player and see out the rest of his contract.\\\\n\\\\nAnd if he does that, he can't keep the captaincy. You can just about get away with your skipper sitting on the bench for a year, but not for three years.\\\\n\\\\nI would say Ten Hag has made a brave, but necessary, decision.\\\\n\\\\n**HAVE YOUR SAY!

Perhaps being given the role on a permanent basis will even help him iron out that kind of behaviour for good.\\\\n\\\\nAs for Maguire, I'd advise him to walk away from Old Trafford before it's too late. The European Championships are looming and by the time England's next major tournament campaign comes around, a heap of other centre-back options could've emerged.\\\\n\\\\nGareth Southgate - who could be gone this time next year - will still have faith in him so long as he plays regular football in the Premier League or at a good level abroad, and he's more than capable of doing that for a Europa League side. Get the system right and Maguire will thrive.\\\\n\\\\n**_Mirror Football is now on Threads!You can follow us here_**\\\\n\\\\n### Simon Bird\\\\n\\\\nWas Erik Ten Hag correct to strip Harry Maguire of the Manchester United captaincy? Yes?\\\\n\\\\nIs Maguire correct to be \\u201cextremely disappointed\\u201d? Damn right.\\\\n\\\\nThe England defender is a class act, who has suffered in silence at being used so little last season by Ten Hag. He made just eight Premier League starts.\\\\n\\\\nTen Hag, last season, and now in pre-season, has made it clear Maguire is not for him. Fair enough, he\\u2019s the boss and has new ideas to move the club forward. Taking the captaincy away is a powerful way of sending Maguire a message. And that harsh message is: clear off. Find a new club.\\\\n\\\\nBut Maguire knows he has plenty to give as a top class footballer. A top six club will surely pick him up, although a \\u00a350m fee and \\u00a3190,000 a week wages may deter some, and United could end up compensating Maguire as part of his exit.\\\\n\\\\nLeave Old Trafford, he must. He can be a major part of England\\u2019s European Championship campaign next summer and still challenge for honours elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\n![Maguire wants to retain his England place](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30486307.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_England-v-North-Macedonia-Group-C-UEFA-EURO-2024-Qualifying-Round.jpg) Maguire wants to retain his England place ( \\\\n\\\\nImage: \\\\n\\\\nGetty Images)\\\", \\\"### Fraser Watson\\\\n\\\\nIt was a decision that Erik ten Hag simply had to make for the sake of both the club and the player.\\\\n\\\\nHarry Maguire's failure to hold down a regular place in the starting XI last season, amid his evident struggles for form, made the notion of him continuing as captain at Manchester United inconceivable. The club has allowed itself to drift through a period of mediocrity in recent years, and Ten Hag making ruthless calls, with the captaincy decision following the release of David de Gea, have been two steps in the right direction.\\\\n\\\\nMaguire now, should he choose to stay, must focus on fighting hard to win his place back. Should that not materialise, then for his own career he must scrap any ideas of earning big money for doing little, and look to move elsewhere in the Premier League.\\\\n\\\\nBruno Fernandes is now the obvious choice to take over. Yes, there are behavioural flaws, but then Roy Keane had them too. And United need to be led by a figure of his quality, and volatility, if they are to challenge for the elite trophies again.\\\\n\\\\n![Bruno Fernandes' captaincy was criticised after Man Utd's 7-0 loss at Anfield](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30486319.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_th146-0_095.jpg) Bruno Fernandes' captaincy was criticised after Man Utd's 7-0 loss at Anfield ( \\\\n\\\\nImage: \\\\n\\\\nAP)\\\\n\\\\n### Andy Dunn\\\\n\\\\nWhen Erik ten Hag sat down for a chat with Harry Maguire the other day, he was not only telling the England defender he was no longer club captain, he was telling him to leave.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the bottom line is that to have the armband taken away - especially at an institution such as Manchester United - is borderline humiliation.\\\\n\\\\nHarry Maguire deserves better than that and has to get out of Old Trafford.\\\\n\\\\nThere is, though, a fundamental problem. If Ten Hag thinks Maguire is nowhere near good enough for a Champions League team, why should the manager of any other Champions League team think differently?\\\\n\\\\nMaguire\\u2019 options might be limited and he might have to stomach going to a club who cannot offer immediate Champions League football.\\\\n\\\\nBut that has to be better than staying at a club that does not seem keen to offer ANY football.\\\\n\\\\nOne way or another - and, it goes without saying, for the sake of his fine England career - Maguire needs to get out of Old Trafford.\\\", \\\"**HAVE YOUR SAY! Who should be Manchester United's next captain?Comment below**\\\\n\\\\n### John Cross\\\\n\\\\nErik ten Hag had no option but to strip Harry Maguire of the captaincy.\\\\n\\\\nThe Manchester United manager has to choose a player who plays every week. Not one who is not a regular. It was turning Maguire into some sort of mascot who would go up and pick up trophies or be a club spokesman. He\\u2019s better than that.\\\\n\\\\nI feel really sorry for Maguire who, even in his statement, has acted with dignity saying he was disappointed but lesser characters would not have stopped there.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\u2019s not forget - this is massive for him. This was his dream.\\\\n\\\\nMaguire now has to move on for the sake of his career - particularly with England and the Euros around the corner. If he\\u2019s not playing for his club then he can\\u2019t be picked for England and unless he watches out, Levi Colwill will take his place.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem United have is there\\u2019s no obvious next captain. It shouldn\\u2019t be Bruno Fernandes - he\\u2019s not a great leader on the pitch. Lisandro Martinez would be my choice if he spoke better English. And the fact United don\\u2019t have an obvious replacement is a worry in itself.\\\\n\\\\n![Marcus Rashford could be a contender for the armband](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30486328.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Manchester-United-v-Chelsea-FC-Premier-League.jpg) Marcus Rashford could be a contender for the armband ( \\\\n\\\\nImage: \\\\n\\\\nGetty Images)\\\\n\\\\n### Mark Jones\\\\n\\\\nThe role of the captain is so often overplayed in football, but obviously it is important enough to Erik ten Hag to do what he's done. Although there is an ulterior motive of course.\\\\n\\\\nTen Hag wants rid of Harry Maguire, obviously, with Manchester United seeking to raise money to help with FFP issues and summer transfers. The strain on the wage budget would be eased too.\\\\n\\\\nA permanent sale might be what many consider to be best for all parties then, but who's asking Maguire?\\\\n\\\\nIt isn't up to him to help United solve the financial problems which are plaguing their summer, with a takeover still up in the air, and you don't walk away from a club as big as them lightly. For Maguire's career, the only way is down.\\\", \\\"So how about a carefully chosen loan move then? One where Maguire is playing every week in his best position, on the left of a three-man back line, and getting enough football to stay in the England conversation for the Euros. Then he can return to Old Trafford for the final year of his contract next summer, and who knows what things could look like then?\\\\n\\\\nAs for his replacement? It'll probably be Bruno Fernandes but there's a Marcus Rashford opportunity here too. Thrown in the armband with his new deal and keep him at his club for life. \\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"## Everton eye move for Southampton winger Kamaldeen Sulemana after Leeds reject \\u00a315m bid

And after the restart, they continued their dominance, deservedly adding two more goals. The result means the Blues remain unbeaten in the WSL this season and on track for an unprecedented fifth consecutive title.Everton's poor record against Chelsea continuesEverton's disappointing start to the season goes on. The Toffees have lost four of their opening six league fixtures.The hosts have not beaten Chelsea since a 3-2 win in 2013, but they did create a handful of good chances in the first period.Heather Payne, Martina Piemonte and Justine Vanhaevermaet all had shots which tested keeper Ann-Katrin Berger.And Berger did brilliantly to keep out Sara Holmgaard in the 44th minute with a diving save. Vanhaevermaet then tapped home the rebound but Everton's equaliser was ruled out for offside.Despite a strong opening period Brian Sorensen's side faded in the second half and were limited to sparse attacks on the break as Chelsea ultimately cantered to their win.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsEverton WomenFormation 3-4-1-21Brosnan28HolmgaardSubstituted forBennisonat 71'minutes20Finnigan2Veje7Wheeler22Galli8Vanhaevermaet23HolmgaardSubstituted forBissellat 53'minutes19Payne14S\\u00f8rensenSubstituted forOlesenat 86'minutes18PiemonteSubstituted forSnoeijsat 71'minutesSubstitutes3Campbell9Duggan10Bennison11Bissell12Ramsey25Snoeijs41Aherne47OlesenChelsea WomenFormation 4-1-4-130Berger15P\\u00e9risset4Bright7Carter21Charles22Cuthbert19Rytting KanerydSubstituted forBeever-Jonesat 83'minutes6N\\u00fcskenBooked at 53minsSubstituted forKirbyat 63'minutes28CankovicSubstituted forIngleat 63'minutes17FlemingBooked at 43minsSubstituted forJamesat 63'minutes20KerrSubstituted forFishelat 77'minutesSubstitutes1Musovic2Fishel5Ingle10James12Lawrence14Kirby18Mjelde26Buchanan33Beever-JonesMatch StatsLive TextMatch ends, Everton Women 0, Chelsea Women 3.Second Half ends, Everton Women 0, Chelsea Women 3.Goal!

The 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder left the Red Devils last summer after five years and has been on a very impressive winning streak in Turkey. Fred has played 17 league games for Fenerbahce so far, winning 16 and drawing one - meaning he is yet to be beating in the league with his new side. His team is currently second in the Super Lig, just two points behind leaders Galatasaray. Some Manchester United fans are now saying they wish Fred was back at Old Trafford. One fan posted on social media: \\\"Never should have been sold. I don't care what anyone thinks our midfield misses this engine!\\\" READ MORE: I played for both Manchester United and Liverpool - but only one club is in my heart READ MORE: Chris Sutton and Paul Merson make same score prediction for Manchester United vs Liverpool FA Cup clash Another fan wrote: \\\"I want him back at United. We lack legs in midfield,\\\" while another added: \\\"Knew it was a big mistake to let him go. That lad was never close to our biggest problem. Heart of a lion, and quality on his day.\\\" Meanwhile, Manchester United's performance this season has been less impressive, with the team struggling to make an impact in the Premier League. Erik ten Hag's team are currently in sixth place, eight points away from a spot in Europe. They've been knocked out of both the Champions League and the Carabao Cup, but they still have a chance in the FA Cup. This weekend, they'll be hosting Liverpool at Old Trafford, reigniting their long-standing rivalry - but will face their arch-rivals without the presence of Fred in midfield.

By contrast, his current mission of helping the U.S. progress in the Under-17 World Cup \\u2014 which continues with a last-16 game against Germany tomorrow \\u2014 probably seems simple.Figueroa has always been the subject of scrutiny. In 2017, as part of the FC Dallas under-12 squad, the striker took part in the Prospects Cup in Florida alongside teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund.The tournament was hosted by Univision, a Spanish-speaking media outlet in the U.S. and South America. As the son of former Premier League defender and Honduras international Maynor Figueroa, he got plenty of attention.\\u201cHe took it all in his stride. He was getting a lot of interviews, but he was never saying, \\u2018This is all about me\\u2019,\\u201d says former FC Dallas under-12s manager John Gall. \\u201cHe was always talking about his team-mates, his club, the situation that he was in. But he scored some incredible goals in that tournament. He had something a little bit different.\\u201d Keyrol Figueroa has made a big impression with the U.S. (Christian Hofer/Getty Images)Born in Honduras but raised in England \\u2014 he qualifies to represent those countries as well as the U.S. \\u2014 Figueroa has no shortage of admirers. One of the more renowned ones is France international and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann, who has offered words of encouragement via WhatsApp messages and InstagramBefore he arrived at Liverpool in 2018, Figueroa was part of the FC Dallas Academy, joining after his father signed for the senior team in January 2016. It was an odd scenario as he was not a player on the FC Dallas academy radar, or someone they had been scouting. His talent, though, was quickly evident.He began in the shadow squad to develop his game understanding and learn standards and expectations, but he made it impossible for Gall to ignore him.\\u201cIt was clear from day one, he was a super competitive kid,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cI remember many times when my under-12 team would play friendlies against the team he was on and he was always the kid that you didn\\u2019t want to play against. He was always dangerous.\\u201cHe was always trying to push and to be the best that he could be so he was constantly knocking on the door. We moved him up and he blossomed into the group I was working with and it was a pretty quick transition.\\u201dGO DEEPERFlash cars and fancy watches off limits - the 'four elements' that define Liverpool's thriving academyNicknamed \\u2018Young Figgy\\u2019, Figueroa was a big personality but Gall insists he was polite, hard-working and humble \\u2014 albeit ferociously competitive.\\u201cHe wanted to be the best player that he could be and he wasn\\u2019t afraid to voice opinions,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cThere were times when we lost games and his shirt was over his head, upset and frustrated. Losing wasn\\u2019t in his repertoire.\\u201dThere was no ego because his father was in the first team. Maynor was a regular watcher of Keyrol\\u2019s training sessions and matches and offered advice to his son on areas to improve such as composure, beating players one-on-one and shot placement.\\u201cMaynor was absolutely fantastic, always supportive,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cHis dad had an incredible technique for striking the ball \\u2014 Figgy inherited the same power, same quality. There are not many kids that strike the ball like that.\\u201d Keyrol Figueroa moved to Liverpool in 2018 (Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)Blessed with natural speed, Figueroa scored every type of goal, and did so with regularity. He arrived as an individual player, trying to prove he deserved to be there, but learned to be his team\\u2019s focal point, holding up the ball, linking play and making good decisions in possession.He featured in an under-13s tournament at St George\\u2019s Park against teams including Birmingham City, Nottingham Forest and Derby County. He continued to stand out in friendlies against Manchester United and Aston Villa.\\u201cYou could tell that was his element, he wanted to be in professional environments,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t care who he was playing, his mentality was the same.\\u201dLiverpool\\u2019s attention was alerted and they moved quickly to bring him to Merseyside as an under-14 player and he excelled. In an interview with Honduran newspaper La Prensa, his mother Sandra Norales said he had scored 90 goals in his first season.He earned his first appearance with the under-18s aged just 15, coming off the bench in a 4-0 mini Merseyside derby against Everton in October 2021.There were three brief appearances during the 2021-22 season before he stepped up to become a more prominent figure in Marc Bridge-Wilkinson\\u2019s under-18s setup as a first-year scholar last season.His breakout came not at the academy, but at this February\\u2019s CONCACAF Under-17 Championship. Figueroa scored seven goals in seven games as he spearheaded the U.S.\\u2019 run to the final, where they lost 3-1 to Mexico.He returned to Liverpool with confidence high and began to earn himself a place in the starting XI, operating as a striker or right-winger. It was from the latter position where he netted a 13-minute hat-trick for the under-18s against Wolverhampton Wanderers in April.Gall remains in contact with Figueroa and his family, exchanging the occasional text message and has been watching him in the World Cup, where he is Liverpool\\u2019s only representative.\\u201cIt\\u2019s great. You always want to see your former players do well,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just delighted he\\u2019s doing well and hopefully it continues and we will be watching in the Premier League one day.\\u201dThat may still be a distant dream for Figueroa, but for now, his focus is simply on the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia and tomorrow\\u2019s meeting with Germany.The U.S. progressed comfortably out of their group, winning their opening two games, with Figueroa scoring the first goal in the second game \\u2014 a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso \\u2014 but Germany will pose a stronger testWhenever he arrives back in Merseyside, he\\u2019ll be aiming to make himself impossible to ignore again.(Top photo: Alex Caparros \\u2013 FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71355,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2023-08-03T16:16:05.000Z\",\n          \"2023-12-30T22:13:51+00:00\",\n          \"2023-08-18T09:45:00.000Z\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"spider_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"mirror\",\n          \"the_guardian\",\n          \"theathletic\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14767,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['life ban', 'gambling', 'eight months', 'scunthorpe united.', 'fine', 'guilty plea', '\\u00a350,000', 'wigan', 'commission', 'warned', 'addiction', 'professional football', 'age', 'bet', 'therapy', 'ivan toney', 'evidence', 'inside information', 'brentford', 'punishment', 'score', 'newcastle', 'future conduct', 'matches', 'fa', 'banned']\",\n          \"['bellingham', 'no 10', 'the athletic', 'loan spell', 'karim benzema', 'pasadena', 'ancelotti', 'nico paz', 'eden hazard', 'marco asensio', 'persistence', 'rose bowl', 'dribbles', 'ac milan', 'federico valverde', 'duels', 'jude bellingham', 'rose bowl stadium', '4-3-3', 'madrid', 'frenchman', 'midfield diamond', 'aerial play', 'mariano diaz', 'brahim diaz', 'alvaro odriozola', 'valverde', 'joselu', 'arda guler', 'luka romero', 'nacho', 'vinicius junior', 'toni kroos', 'patience', '4-4-2', 'fran garcia', 'carlo ancelotti', 'attack', 'key passes', 'paris saint-germain', 'kylian mbappe', 'brahim', 'real madrid', 'santiago bernabeu', 'system', 'transfer', 'passes', 'fikayo tomori', 'englishman', 'powers of persuasion.', 'milan', 'davide']\",\n          \"['elliot anderson', 'newcastle united', 'nottingham forest', 'trafalgar square.', 'trophies', 'jacob murphy', 'football', 'tommy', 'mad dog', 'nick pope', 'chelsea', 'martin dubravka', 'non-stop.', 'england.', 'alex isak', 'juventus', 'kieran trippier', 'callum wilson', 'joelinton', 'european championship', \\\"st james' park\\\", 'top four', 'joey', 'pressing', 'yellowstone', 'everton', 'jason tindall', 'tyneside', 'newcastle.', 'bruno guimaraes', 'sean longstaff', 'sven botman', 'pre-season', 'newcastle', 'atlanta', 'world cup', 'leicester city', 'anthony gordon', 'murphy', 'allan saint-maximin', 'kevin costner', 'matt ritchie', 'spanish greyhound', 'jamaal lascelles', 'matt targett', 'burn', 'dan burn', 'miguel almiron', 'fabian schar', 'carabao cup', 'champions league', 'the athletic', 'midfielder', 'london', 'england', 'eddie howe', 'running']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
