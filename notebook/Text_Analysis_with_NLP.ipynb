And after the restart, they continued their dominance, deservedly adding two more goals. The result means the Blues remain unbeaten in the WSL this season and on track for an unprecedented fifth consecutive title.Everton's poor record against Chelsea continuesEverton's disappointing start to the season goes on. The Toffees have lost four of their opening six league fixtures.The hosts have not beaten Chelsea since a 3-2 win in 2013, but they did create a handful of good chances in the first period.Heather Payne, Martina Piemonte and Justine Vanhaevermaet all had shots which tested keeper Ann-Katrin Berger.And Berger did brilliantly to keep out Sara Holmgaard in the 44th minute with a diving save. Vanhaevermaet then tapped home the rebound but Everton's equaliser was ruled out for offside.Despite a strong opening period Brian Sorensen's side faded in the second half and were limited to sparse attacks on the break as Chelsea ultimately cantered to their win.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsEverton WomenFormation 3-4-1-21Brosnan28HolmgaardSubstituted forBennisonat 71'minutes20Finnigan2Veje7Wheeler22Galli8Vanhaevermaet23HolmgaardSubstituted forBissellat 53'minutes19Payne14S\\u00f8rensenSubstituted forOlesenat 86'minutes18PiemonteSubstituted forSnoeijsat 71'minutesSubstitutes3Campbell9Duggan10Bennison11Bissell12Ramsey25Snoeijs41Aherne47OlesenChelsea WomenFormation 4-1-4-130Berger15P\\u00e9risset4Bright7Carter21Charles22Cuthbert19Rytting KanerydSubstituted forBeever-Jonesat 83'minutes6N\\u00fcskenBooked at 53minsSubstituted forKirbyat 63'minutes28CankovicSubstituted forIngleat 63'minutes17FlemingBooked at 43minsSubstituted forJamesat 63'minutes20KerrSubstituted forFishelat 77'minutesSubstitutes1Musovic2Fishel5Ingle10James12Lawrence14Kirby18Mjelde26Buchanan33Beever-JonesMatch StatsLive TextMatch ends, Everton Women 0, Chelsea Women 3.Second Half ends, Everton Women 0, Chelsea Women 3.Goal!

The 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder left the Red Devils last summer after five years and has been on a very impressive winning streak in Turkey. Fred has played 17 league games for Fenerbahce so far, winning 16 and drawing one - meaning he is yet to be beating in the league with his new side. His team is currently second in the Super Lig, just two points behind leaders Galatasaray. Some Manchester United fans are now saying they wish Fred was back at Old Trafford. One fan posted on social media: \\\"Never should have been sold. I don't care what anyone thinks our midfield misses this engine!\\\" READ MORE: I played for both Manchester United and Liverpool - but only one club is in my heart READ MORE: Chris Sutton and Paul Merson make same score prediction for Manchester United vs Liverpool FA Cup clash Another fan wrote: \\\"I want him back at United. We lack legs in midfield,\\\" while another added: \\\"Knew it was a big mistake to let him go. That lad was never close to our biggest problem. Heart of a lion, and quality on his day.\\\" Meanwhile, Manchester United's performance this season has been less impressive, with the team struggling to make an impact in the Premier League. Erik ten Hag's team are currently in sixth place, eight points away from a spot in Europe. They've been knocked out of both the Champions League and the Carabao Cup, but they still have a chance in the FA Cup. This weekend, they'll be hosting Liverpool at Old Trafford, reigniting their long-standing rivalry - but will face their arch-rivals without the presence of Fred in midfield.

By contrast, his current mission of helping the U.S. progress in the Under-17 World Cup \\u2014 which continues with a last-16 game against Germany tomorrow \\u2014 probably seems simple.Figueroa has always been the subject of scrutiny. In 2017, as part of the FC Dallas under-12 squad, the striker took part in the Prospects Cup in Florida alongside teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund.The tournament was hosted by Univision, a Spanish-speaking media outlet in the U.S. and South America. As the son of former Premier League defender and Honduras international Maynor Figueroa, he got plenty of attention.\\u201cHe took it all in his stride. He was getting a lot of interviews, but he was never saying, \\u2018This is all about me\\u2019,\\u201d says former FC Dallas under-12s manager John Gall. \\u201cHe was always talking about his team-mates, his club, the situation that he was in. But he scored some incredible goals in that tournament. He had something a little bit different.\\u201d Keyrol Figueroa has made a big impression with the U.S. (Christian Hofer/Getty Images)Born in Honduras but raised in England \\u2014 he qualifies to represent those countries as well as the U.S. \\u2014 Figueroa has no shortage of admirers. One of the more renowned ones is France international and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann, who has offered words of encouragement via WhatsApp messages and InstagramBefore he arrived at Liverpool in 2018, Figueroa was part of the FC Dallas Academy, joining after his father signed for the senior team in January 2016. It was an odd scenario as he was not a player on the FC Dallas academy radar, or someone they had been scouting. His talent, though, was quickly evident.He began in the shadow squad to develop his game understanding and learn standards and expectations, but he made it impossible for Gall to ignore him.\\u201cIt was clear from day one, he was a super competitive kid,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cI remember many times when my under-12 team would play friendlies against the team he was on and he was always the kid that you didn\\u2019t want to play against. He was always dangerous.\\u201cHe was always trying to push and to be the best that he could be so he was constantly knocking on the door. We moved him up and he blossomed into the group I was working with and it was a pretty quick transition.\\u201dGO DEEPERFlash cars and fancy watches off limits - the 'four elements' that define Liverpool's thriving academyNicknamed \\u2018Young Figgy\\u2019, Figueroa was a big personality but Gall insists he was polite, hard-working and humble \\u2014 albeit ferociously competitive.\\u201cHe wanted to be the best player that he could be and he wasn\\u2019t afraid to voice opinions,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cThere were times when we lost games and his shirt was over his head, upset and frustrated. Losing wasn\\u2019t in his repertoire.\\u201dThere was no ego because his father was in the first team. Maynor was a regular watcher of Keyrol\\u2019s training sessions and matches and offered advice to his son on areas to improve such as composure, beating players one-on-one and shot placement.\\u201cMaynor was absolutely fantastic, always supportive,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cHis dad had an incredible technique for striking the ball \\u2014 Figgy inherited the same power, same quality. There are not many kids that strike the ball like that.\\u201d Keyrol Figueroa moved to Liverpool in 2018 (Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)Blessed with natural speed, Figueroa scored every type of goal, and did so with regularity. He arrived as an individual player, trying to prove he deserved to be there, but learned to be his team\\u2019s focal point, holding up the ball, linking play and making good decisions in possession.He featured in an under-13s tournament at St George\\u2019s Park against teams including Birmingham City, Nottingham Forest and Derby County. He continued to stand out in friendlies against Manchester United and Aston Villa.\\u201cYou could tell that was his element, he wanted to be in professional environments,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t care who he was playing, his mentality was the same.\\u201dLiverpool\\u2019s attention was alerted and they moved quickly to bring him to Merseyside as an under-14 player and he excelled. In an interview with Honduran newspaper La Prensa, his mother Sandra Norales said he had scored 90 goals in his first season.He earned his first appearance with the under-18s aged just 15, coming off the bench in a 4-0 mini Merseyside derby against Everton in October 2021.There were three brief appearances during the 2021-22 season before he stepped up to become a more prominent figure in Marc Bridge-Wilkinson\\u2019s under-18s setup as a first-year scholar last season.His breakout came not at the academy, but at this February\\u2019s CONCACAF Under-17 Championship. Figueroa scored seven goals in seven games as he spearheaded the U.S.\\u2019 run to the final, where they lost 3-1 to Mexico.He returned to Liverpool with confidence high and began to earn himself a place in the starting XI, operating as a striker or right-winger. It was from the latter position where he netted a 13-minute hat-trick for the under-18s against Wolverhampton Wanderers in April.Gall remains in contact with Figueroa and his family, exchanging the occasional text message and has been watching him in the World Cup, where he is Liverpool\\u2019s only representative.\\u201cIt\\u2019s great. You always want to see your former players do well,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just delighted he\\u2019s doing well and hopefully it continues and we will be watching in the Premier League one day.\\u201dThat may still be a distant dream for Figueroa, but for now, his focus is simply on the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia and tomorrow\\u2019s meeting with Germany.The U.S. progressed comfortably out of their group, winning their opening two games, with Figueroa scoring the first goal in the second game \\u2014 a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso \\u2014 but Germany will pose a stronger testWhenever he arrives back in Merseyside, he\\u2019ll be aiming to make himself impossible to ignore again.(Top photo: Alex Caparros \\u2013 FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"names\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 74555,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Gianluca Vialli - and, John Obi Mikel, Salomon Kalou, Florent MaloudaChelsea, Gianluca Vialli, Vialli, John Terry, Petr Cech, Michael Essien, Gianfranco Zola, Claude Makelele, Chelsea, Chelsea, Salomon Kalou, Chelsea, Catherine Ivill/Getty Images, John Obi Mikel, Salomon Kalou, Florent Malouda, Virgin Media, Jiangsu Suning, Eidur Gudjohnsen, Carlo Cudicini, Frank Leboeuf, Owen Hargreaves, Claudio Pizarro, Lucio, Roy Makaay, Stefan Effenberg\",\n          \"Manuel Lanzini, LeagueFormer, Manuel Lanzini, Lanzini, Tottenham Hotspur, Lanzini, Jorge Brito, Manuel, Lanzini, Al-Jazira, James Rodriguez, Everton\",\n          \"Callum Hudson-Odoi, Tino Livramento\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clubs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 74886,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Manchester United, United, Old Trafford, Everton, Ajax, Ajax, United, United, United, United, Dutchman, Old Trafford, United, United, TikTok, YouTube, Manchester, SavedYou\",\n          \"Manchester United, Old Trafford, INEOS, United, United, INEOS, Sky Sports', Manchester United, INEOS, OGC Nice, Nice, the Champions League, United, TikTok, YouTube, Manchester, SavedYou\",\n          \"Lyon, MarseilleLyon, Manchester United, Google News - CLICK, Apple News - CLICK, Apple, WhatsApp, Mirror Football, TNT Sports, the Premier League, Champions League, Serie A, UFC, WWE, MLB, TNT Sports, Sky\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fee\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19317,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"more than \\u00a33 million, 350,000\",\n          \"50, 50, 42.5million\",\n          \"30, 70 per cent\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And after the restart, they continued their dominance, deservedly adding two more goals. The result means the Blues remain unbeaten in the WSL this season and on track for an unprecedented fifth consecutive title.Everton's poor record against Chelsea continuesEverton's disappointing start to the season goes on. The Toffees have lost four of their opening six league fixtures.The hosts have not beaten Chelsea since a 3-2 win in 2013, but they did create a handful of good chances in the first period.Heather Payne, Martina Piemonte and Justine Vanhaevermaet all had shots which tested keeper Ann-Katrin Berger.And Berger did brilliantly to keep out Sara Holmgaard in the 44th minute with a diving save. Vanhaevermaet then tapped home the rebound but Everton's equaliser was ruled out for offside.Despite a strong opening period Brian Sorensen's side faded in the second half and were limited to sparse attacks on the break as Chelsea ultimately cantered to their win.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsEverton WomenFormation 3-4-1-21Brosnan28HolmgaardSubstituted forBennisonat 71'minutes20Finnigan2Veje7Wheeler22Galli8Vanhaevermaet23HolmgaardSubstituted forBissellat 53'minutes19Payne14S\\u00f8rensenSubstituted forOlesenat 86'minutes18PiemonteSubstituted forSnoeijsat 71'minutesSubstitutes3Campbell9Duggan10Bennison11Bissell12Ramsey25Snoeijs41Aherne47OlesenChelsea WomenFormation 4-1-4-130Berger15P\\u00e9risset4Bright7Carter21Charles22Cuthbert19Rytting KanerydSubstituted forBeever-Jonesat 83'minutes6N\\u00fcskenBooked at 53minsSubstituted forKirbyat 63'minutes28CankovicSubstituted forIngleat 63'minutes17FlemingBooked at 43minsSubstituted forJamesat 63'minutes20KerrSubstituted forFishelat 77'minutesSubstitutes1Musovic2Fishel5Ingle10James12Lawrence14Kirby18Mjelde26Buchanan33Beever-JonesMatch StatsLive TextMatch ends, Everton Women 0, Chelsea Women 3.Second Half ends, Everton Women 0, Chelsea Women 3.Goal!

The 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder left the Red Devils last summer after five years and has been on a very impressive winning streak in Turkey. Fred has played 17 league games for Fenerbahce so far, winning 16 and drawing one - meaning he is yet to be beating in the league with his new side. His team is currently second in the Super Lig, just two points behind leaders Galatasaray. Some Manchester United fans are now saying they wish Fred was back at Old Trafford. One fan posted on social media: \\\"Never should have been sold. I don't care what anyone thinks our midfield misses this engine!\\\" READ MORE: I played for both Manchester United and Liverpool - but only one club is in my heart READ MORE: Chris Sutton and Paul Merson make same score prediction for Manchester United vs Liverpool FA Cup clash Another fan wrote: \\\"I want him back at United. We lack legs in midfield,\\\" while another added: \\\"Knew it was a big mistake to let him go. That lad was never close to our biggest problem. Heart of a lion, and quality on his day.\\\" Meanwhile, Manchester United's performance this season has been less impressive, with the team struggling to make an impact in the Premier League. Erik ten Hag's team are currently in sixth place, eight points away from a spot in Europe. They've been knocked out of both the Champions League and the Carabao Cup, but they still have a chance in the FA Cup. This weekend, they'll be hosting Liverpool at Old Trafford, reigniting their long-standing rivalry - but will face their arch-rivals without the presence of Fred in midfield.

By contrast, his current mission of helping the U.S. progress in the Under-17 World Cup \\u2014 which continues with a last-16 game against Germany tomorrow \\u2014 probably seems simple.Figueroa has always been the subject of scrutiny. In 2017, as part of the FC Dallas under-12 squad, the striker took part in the Prospects Cup in Florida alongside teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund.The tournament was hosted by Univision, a Spanish-speaking media outlet in the U.S. and South America. As the son of former Premier League defender and Honduras international Maynor Figueroa, he got plenty of attention.\\u201cHe took it all in his stride. He was getting a lot of interviews, but he was never saying, \\u2018This is all about me\\u2019,\\u201d says former FC Dallas under-12s manager John Gall. \\u201cHe was always talking about his team-mates, his club, the situation that he was in. But he scored some incredible goals in that tournament. He had something a little bit different.\\u201d Keyrol Figueroa has made a big impression with the U.S. (Christian Hofer/Getty Images)Born in Honduras but raised in England \\u2014 he qualifies to represent those countries as well as the U.S. \\u2014 Figueroa has no shortage of admirers. One of the more renowned ones is France international and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann, who has offered words of encouragement via WhatsApp messages and InstagramBefore he arrived at Liverpool in 2018, Figueroa was part of the FC Dallas Academy, joining after his father signed for the senior team in January 2016. It was an odd scenario as he was not a player on the FC Dallas academy radar, or someone they had been scouting. His talent, though, was quickly evident.He began in the shadow squad to develop his game understanding and learn standards and expectations, but he made it impossible for Gall to ignore him.\\u201cIt was clear from day one, he was a super competitive kid,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cI remember many times when my under-12 team would play friendlies against the team he was on and he was always the kid that you didn\\u2019t want to play against. He was always dangerous.\\u201cHe was always trying to push and to be the best that he could be so he was constantly knocking on the door. We moved him up and he blossomed into the group I was working with and it was a pretty quick transition.\\u201dGO DEEPERFlash cars and fancy watches off limits - the 'four elements' that define Liverpool's thriving academyNicknamed \\u2018Young Figgy\\u2019, Figueroa was a big personality but Gall insists he was polite, hard-working and humble \\u2014 albeit ferociously competitive.\\u201cHe wanted to be the best player that he could be and he wasn\\u2019t afraid to voice opinions,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cThere were times when we lost games and his shirt was over his head, upset and frustrated. Losing wasn\\u2019t in his repertoire.\\u201dThere was no ego because his father was in the first team. Maynor was a regular watcher of Keyrol\\u2019s training sessions and matches and offered advice to his son on areas to improve such as composure, beating players one-on-one and shot placement.\\u201cMaynor was absolutely fantastic, always supportive,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cHis dad had an incredible technique for striking the ball \\u2014 Figgy inherited the same power, same quality. There are not many kids that strike the ball like that.\\u201d Keyrol Figueroa moved to Liverpool in 2018 (Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)Blessed with natural speed, Figueroa scored every type of goal, and did so with regularity. He arrived as an individual player, trying to prove he deserved to be there, but learned to be his team\\u2019s focal point, holding up the ball, linking play and making good decisions in possession.He featured in an under-13s tournament at St George\\u2019s Park against teams including Birmingham City, Nottingham Forest and Derby County. He continued to stand out in friendlies against Manchester United and Aston Villa.\\u201cYou could tell that was his element, he wanted to be in professional environments,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t care who he was playing, his mentality was the same.\\u201dLiverpool\\u2019s attention was alerted and they moved quickly to bring him to Merseyside as an under-14 player and he excelled. In an interview with Honduran newspaper La Prensa, his mother Sandra Norales said he had scored 90 goals in his first season.He earned his first appearance with the under-18s aged just 15, coming off the bench in a 4-0 mini Merseyside derby against Everton in October 2021.There were three brief appearances during the 2021-22 season before he stepped up to become a more prominent figure in Marc Bridge-Wilkinson\\u2019s under-18s setup as a first-year scholar last season.His breakout came not at the academy, but at this February\\u2019s CONCACAF Under-17 Championship. Figueroa scored seven goals in seven games as he spearheaded the U.S.\\u2019 run to the final, where they lost 3-1 to Mexico.He returned to Liverpool with confidence high and began to earn himself a place in the starting XI, operating as a striker or right-winger. It was from the latter position where he netted a 13-minute hat-trick for the under-18s against Wolverhampton Wanderers in April.Gall remains in contact with Figueroa and his family, exchanging the occasional text message and has been watching him in the World Cup, where he is Liverpool\\u2019s only representative.\\u201cIt\\u2019s great. You always want to see your former players do well,\\u201d says Gall. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just delighted he\\u2019s doing well and hopefully it continues and we will be watching in the Premier League one day.\\u201dThat may still be a distant dream for Figueroa, but for now, his focus is simply on the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia and tomorrow\\u2019s meeting with Germany.The U.S. progressed comfortably out of their group, winning their opening two games, with Figueroa scoring the first goal in the second game \\u2014 a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso \\u2014 but Germany will pose a stronger testWhenever he arrives back in Merseyside, he\\u2019ll be aiming to make himself impossible to ignore again.(Top photo: Alex Caparros \\u2013 FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"names\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 74555,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Gianluca Vialli -
